Offline editing of Overland map files
-------------------------------------

Last modified by Samson, Dec. 25, 2006

First thing you need obviously would be a premade image file that
represents your mud's world. It needs to be in png format to be read
by the mud. Older .raw files can be read in by the code and will save
back as png files. Windows Paint, Gimp, Photoshop, and most other
image editing programs should be able to read and write png files.

Secondly, you need to gather the RGB values for the various colors
your image file is using to represent your terrain. If your map uses
the same color to represent more than one type, now would be a good
time to make sure each terrain type has its own unique color. Once
you've done that, use the "dropper" icon and pass the mouse over each
color and record the RGB values shown. One thing to note, if your image
file blends the borders of 2 colors, this will throw off the in game
map. You'll need to make certain that any blended borders are edited
so that they are solid. Any colors that don't match the RGB values
exactly will be turned into ocean sectors by the code.

Lastly, make a note of the image's dimensions. How many pixels across,
and how many down. You'll need this information to set your MAX_X and
MAX_Y values in the overland.h file, as well as for loading the
file later on.

When you have your png image fixed up just how you want it, upload it into
the maps directory on the mud. Once the game loads with the map in place,
take a quick tour around parts of it. Check to be sure the edges are where
you expect them and so forth.



The following color codes can be used to create the proper colors needed
by the Overland code to produce the sector types for the map. Please do
not change these colors when editing the map or the mud's code will not
be able to load the map properly. Each sector type will be followed by the
red, green, and blue values to make the color using the custom color functions.
