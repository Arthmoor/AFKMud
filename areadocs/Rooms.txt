=== The #ROOM block

Last Modified by Samson, Nov. 26, 2014

"If you build it, they will come." - Field of Dreams
An appropriate quote for this section. Without rooms, people will have nowwhere to go.
Without rooms, you can't have a place for mobiles or objects to exist.
In short, without rooms you have basically nothing. You have no world to explore!

You may have as many rooms as you like, within the assigned vnum range of the area.
They can be placed in any order you wish in the file, but each section must obey the syntax.

The syntax of a #ROOM block is:

#ROOM
-----
String literal. This is required to mark the beginning of a room block.

Vnum       <#>
--------------
An integer value > 0. This value must fall within the range assigned to the builder who owns this area, or in the event
that this area is installed, it must fall within the vnum range specified in the #AREAHEADER section of the file.

Name       <string>~
--------------------
The short title for this room, which will show up even in brief mode to quickly identify the location.

Sector     <string>~
--------------------
The name of the terrain type which applies to this room. Terrain affects movement costs
through the room and certain terrain types require other special capabilities to pass
through them, such as boats, flight, or other magical means. These terrain types also
apply to use on the overland graphical maps, and will also be visible on the regional
mini-map that is displayed in each room.

Choose from the following table:

Sector:      | Move | Description

Note that indoors, underground, underwater, and oceanfloors do not prevent the display of
weather messages and the like. To do that, the indoors room flag is required.

* Has not been completely implemented yet.

Auction houses require that the next vnum used be set aside to use as a storage
room for the items, much like a petshop. Be sure and flag the storage room with the
appropriate flags so no players can get in, or the mobs can get out.
There must also be a mob in the room with the AUCTION flag.

-----

To create a watchtower: 
 
in the room you want the tower connected to, make an exit in whichever 
direction you choose, though up usually makes the most sense. 
Flag it as overland, and optionally ( though HIGHLY recommended ) as nomob. 
This exit can lead to any vnum you want, but it would be a Really Bad Plan(tm) 
to assign this to an existing overland room. You then need to assign it 
coordinates for where on the overland the watchtower is supposed to be. 
 
Example for how to setup the source room: 
 
redit exit up 7035 overland nomob 
redit excoord up 468 380 
 
In the room that will be the tower, flag it as "map" and as "watchtower" and 
then make an exit that returns to the room you just made. 
 
Example for how to setup the target room: 
 
redit flags map watchtower 
redit exit down 7004 
 
That should do it, and you should end up with a nice view of the overland :)

-----

Stats        <#1> <#2> <#3> <#4> <#5>
-------------------------------------
Additional statistics which can affect this room.

#1 = Teleport delay. Amount of time in game pulses before the occupant is transported out.
#2 = Teleport vnum. Target vnum of the location for a room flagged as teleport.
#3 = Tunnel value. Number of occupants a tunnel flagged room can hold before it won't let anyone else in.
     This count includes NPCs, which includes player pet hoardes.
#4 = Base lighting value. Minimum amount of natural light this room has.
     0 should be used for a baseline. Meaning natural darkness at night.
     Negative values can be used for magical darkness that will keep the room dark even during daylight.
     Positive values can be used for magical lighting that keeps the room lit even at night.
     The code to support this fully has not been completed yet.
#5 = Maximum weight limit. Or, the capacity this room holds. This is measured in object weight.
     The more objects placed in the room, the less capacity it has to hold more.
     If this is not set, the default value is 100000 units. As players drop stuff and take stuff
     out, the game keeps track of this in an internal value.

#1 and #2 will not function on a room with no teleport flag.
#3 will have no affect on a room with no tunnel flag.

Desc         <string>~
----------------------
The detailed descriptive text which shows up when entering the room if brief mode is off, or
when explicitly calling the look command. This description will be presented during daylight hours,
between sunrise and sunset. Or if no night description is supplied, it will be displayed at all hours.

A well written room should in theory avoid using "you" in ways which dictate how a player should feel,
or giving them "commands" as though they performed some action upon entering the room which may
not actually have happened, and should avoid describing occupants or contents which may not be there
physically - such as "The king is on his throne" or "The sword sticks up out of the ground."

This isn't always possible or practical, so consider it a guideline.

Nightdesc    <string>~
----------------------
Optional descriptive text for how the room should look after dark and before sunrise the next day.
This should follow the same general guidelines as the normal daylight description.

Affect       <Format varies>
----------------------------
Permanent affects this room has. These affects will be imparted temporarily upon anyone entering
the room, and will be removed again when they leave. This applies to NPCs as well. This will
not work on objects left in the room or carried in by players/NPCs.

Affects will be listed based on location, types, and other data associated with them.
These are best left to handle via the OLC as the format is different depending on the
location of the particular affect. A room can have as many affect sections as are
appropriate, but should be kept within reason or the room could produce an overbalancing situation.

#EXIT
#ENDEXIT
--------
See the Misc.txt file for the format of Exit blocks - which are optional. Yes, you can make rooms with no way out!

#EXDESC
#ENDEXDESC
----------
See the Misc.txt file for the format of Extra Description blocks. These are optional.

#MUDPROG
#ENDPROG
--------
See the Misc.txt file for the format of Mudprog blocks. These are optional.

Reset        <Format varies>
----------------------------
Determines what sort of things are placed in this room after the game boots up, and during the
regular "tick reset" cycle of each area.
The following commands are used for the reset format:

   For all resets, percent = 1-100% chance that this reset will load. Any resets which depend on this reset
   will only load if the parent reset loads.

   M <mob-vnum> <limit> <room-vnum> <map-number> <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate> <percent>
     Load a mobile into a room.
     Primary reset. Can have dependent G, E, X, or Y resets. G and E resets can in turn have dependent P, or H resets.
       mob-vnum = The vnum of the mob you want to load here. Generally should be something from the area you're building.
       limit = This value is no longer in use for M resets, but something must be put here or things break. Just use a 1.
       room-vnum = The room vnum the mob should reset to. Should almost always match the room you're making, but for the overland it needs to be properly specified.
       map-number = The number of the continent on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       x-coordinate = X coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       y-coordinate = Y coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.

   O <obj-vnum> <limit> <room-vnum> <map-number> <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate> <percent>
     Load an object into a room.
     Primary reset. Can have dependent P, W, H, or T resets.
       obj-vnum = The vnum of the object you want to load here. Generally should be something from the area you're building.
       limit = Maximum number of these objs to load in the room at one time. If this object is limited (ie: rare) and this reset would cause it to go over the limit, the reset will fail.
       room-vnum = The room vnum the object should reset to. Should almost always match the room you're making, but for the overland it needs to be properly specified.
       map-number = The number o the continent on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       x-coordinate = X coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       y-coordinate = Y coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.

   Z <rt_type> <level> <value1> <value2> <value3> <sockets> <room-vnum> <map-number> <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate> <percent>
     Load a random treasure item into a room.
     Primary reset. Has no dependent resets.
       rt_type = The type of random treasure this item should be:
         -1 - Roll utterly randomly, ignore all other fields but level.
          1 - Gold /* Why you would do this is beyond me, but */
          2 - Gems

          6 - Armor
          7 - Weapon
          8 - Rune
       level = Level to use to generate the item. Item is generated as though a mob of this level died.
       value1 = Type of weapon or armor to generate. -1 = choose at random. Ignored by all other types.
       value2 = Material for the armor or weapon. -1 = choose at random. Ignored by all other types.
       value3 = Weapon quality. -1 = choose at random. Ignored for all other types.
       sockets = Number of sockets to give the weapon or armor. -1 = choose at random. Ignored by all other types.
       room-vnum = The room vnum the object should reset to. Should almost always match the room you're making, but for the overland it needs to be properly specified.
       map-number = The number o the continent on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       x-coordinate = X coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.
       y-coordinate = Y coord for a position on the overland. -1 for a standard room.

   H <percent>
     Sets the hide flag on the last successfully loaded object.

     Put an item in a container.
     Dependent reset. The previous parent reset must be one of: E, G, O, or P. Otherwise will not load.
     Can also have dependent P or H resets.
       nest level = Container nesting level. If a previous P reset loaded and is a container, a second P reset with a higher
         nesting level will load the item into that container instead of the primary reset.
       obj-vnum = The object vnum you are trying to load. Should always be something from the area you're building.
       limit = Maximum number of copies to load into the container at one time. If this object is limited (ie: rare) and this reset would cause it to go over the limit, the reset will fail.
       container-vnum = The container the object is being reset into. Should always be something from the area you're building.

   W <nest level> <rt_type> <level> <value1> <value2> <value3> <sockets> <container-vnum> <percent>

     Dependent reset. The previous parent reset must be an O. Otherwise will not load.
     Cannot have dependent resets.

     Dependent reset. The previous parent reset must be an M. Otherwise will not load.
       limit = Maximum number of copies to give the mob at one time. If this object is limited (ie: rare) and this reset would cause it to go over the limit, the reset will fail.

Desc      You stand in a 20' x 20' cubicle made of well-cut 2' granite blocks inlaid 
with mithril.  In the center of one wall stands a small door, made of 
adamanite, and inlaid with mithril.  Past it, you can see stairs leading up.
Above the door is a small plaque made from steel, with something engraved
on it.  Along one of the walls, a large rack holds a dazzling array of arms,
and along the opposite wall is another rack of armor.  Along another wall sits
a desk, with an odd looking weapon atop it.  The rest of that wall is take up
by bookshelves.  In the center of the room stands a large map table.
A large cage sits on a table, with a giant rabbit inside.

nor can the light be called light, per say.  The axe itself is made from a 
substance called darksteel, and the light, while it is light, is very dark 
light, and the entire weapon appears evil.

ExDescKey    stack paper papers~
ExDesc       This stack of papers is made from the finest vellum from what was once the 
city of Midgaard.  Upon it is scribed what appear to be maps of someplace, and 
along with the maps are sheets of runes describing something, but you cannot 
make out the writing.

ExDescKey    bookshelves bookshelf book books~
ExDesc       These bookshelves, made from the substance known as darksteel, stand from 
floor to ceiling.  Many books and tomes sit upon the shelves, all with metal 
and gemstone-studded covers.  The books include such titles as The Art of War,
The Prince, and various tomes dealing with castle construction, seige warfare,
logistics, battlefield tactics, and various tactics used by the different 
races of the world, including some you have never heard of.

ExDescKey    table map~
ExDesc       This table is made of a substance known as Blackrock, and is inlaid with what 
appears to be ruby,  although you cannot begin to figure out how it was put 
there.   The surface of the map table shows the entire world,  and  you are 
amazed to see that the water, and the stones, and the houses, and the people, 
are all seemingly real, and, touching all of those in turn, you are astonished
to find out that they ARE real!

ExDescKey    rabbit cage~
ExDesc       The cage appears to be made from solid inch thick bars of mithril.  It
has to be, to hold in the rabbit.  A large dish of lettuce and another
of water sit on the floor of the cage, beside the rabbit.  The rabbit
is a giant black and white checkered one, with sharp looking teeth.  
You wonder why Dwip feeds the thing lettuce, and not people.
