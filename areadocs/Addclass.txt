Adding a new class
------------------

Last modified by Samson, 6/19/03

1. In mud.h, find MAX_CLASS and increase by one. If you're changing a
   class into a new one, this isn't necessary.

2. In const.c, find the npc_class table. Change the first empty slot to 
   the name of your new class. You should be changing something like "pc13".

3. Add your new class to the class_types list in mud.h. In stock code, this
   list ends with CLASS_BARD as the last member.

4. At this point, your done with the code. Make clean, and recompile.
   Don't reboot yet though.

5. Using an existing class file, copy it's contents to a new file.

6. Set the class# in the file to 1 LESS than MAX_CLASS.
   ( Starts countng with 0 ).

7. At this point, you're ready to upload the class file.
   Don't reboot just yet.

8. In entry.are, you need to add your new class to the appropriate speech_prog
   lists for the races you are going to allow to use it. The speech_prog should
   look similar to:

#MUDPROG
Progtype  speech_prog~
Arglist   p mage~
Comlist   if level($n) == 1
mpmset 0.$n class mage
mptrlook 0.$n 120
mpat 0.$n mpforce 0.$n bounce
endif
~
#ENDPROG

   It should be tacked on to the end of the existing list.

9. After the reboot, use the setclass command to fine-tune the settings
   for the new class.

10. You should then be ready to do skill setup for this new class.
    Have fun, skill setting could well be a document all its own :)

That should be it. Your new class should be ready for use.
