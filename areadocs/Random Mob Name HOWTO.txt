Random Mobile Names HOWTO

Version 0.1
Written by Tarl

One of the additions we have made to the stock smaug codebase is the ability to 
allow mobiles to have random names. This document aims to describe the methods 
required to configure this on your copy of the AFKMud codebase.

Random mobile names will require code alterations, as well as the creation of 
one or more files, the format of which will be described later.

Code Alterations:

In the AFKMud codebase, under the src directory you'll see the file reset.c

On approximately line 1569 you will see the following code snippet. 


   /* Added by Tarl 4 Dec 02 so that if a mob is 'flagged' namegen in
          his name, it will auto assign a random name to it. Similarly,
          occurances of namegen in the long_descr and description will be
          replaced with the name. */
   
   namegenCheckString = STRALLOC( mob->name );
   namegenCheckString = one_argument(namegenCheckString, namegenCheck);
   
   /* Modified by Tarl 5 Dec 02 to add extra namegen options. ie, namegen_gr will pick a name
      suitable for Graecian mobs.

      To add more, edit the line below this, and add an if-check similar to the one starting
      with if (!strcasecmp( namegenCheck, "namegen_gr") ) */
      
   if ( ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen") ) || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_gr") )
      || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_ven") ) || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_orc") ) )
      {

      <snipped>

  if (!strcasecmp( namegenCheck, "namegen_gr") ) {
    namePicked = TRUE;
    if (mob->sex == 2) {
       sprintf(file, "%s%s", SYSTEM_DIR, "namegen_gr_female.txt");
    } else {
       sprintf(file, "%s%s", SYSTEM_DIR, "namegen_gr_other.txt");
    }
  }
  if (!strcasecmp( namegenCheck, "namegen_ven") ) {
    namePicked = TRUE;
    if (mob->sex == 2) {
       sprintf(file, "%s%s", SYSTEM_DIR, "namegen_ven_female.txt");
    } else {
       sprintf(file, "%s%s", SYSTEM_DIR, "namegen_ven_other.txt");
    }
  }


Most of the following instructions are documented as comments in the code, so feel free to skip over them
here if the code instructions are sufficient for you.

In order to add a new random mobile name section, you need to edit the if check shown above, and add a similar
option that is suitable for you. Please note that this string is required to start with namegen_ 
An example of adding a new section called namegen_example is shown below:

 if ( ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen") ) || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_gr") )
      || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_ven") ) || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_orc") ) 
      || ( !strcasecmp(namegenCheck, "namegen_example") ) )
      {



Next, you will have to add an if check similar to the ones beginning with: if (!strcasecmp( namegenCheck, "namegen_gr") ) {

We base our random names on the sex of our mobiles, but you may choose to remove this check, or to alter it to
some other attribute. The important parts of the if check that are required are the following:

namePicked = TRUE; 
sprintf(file, "%s%s", SYSTEM_DIR, "namegen_ven_female.txt"); 

namegen_ven_female.txt should be replaced with the filename of your random names, for more information on the format of this file,
please see below.

Thats all the code alterations that are required.

Random Name File Format

The random name file (used in the code as outlined above) should have the following format:

[start]
A
Ab
Ac
Ad
[middle]
a
ae
ae
au
ao
are
[end]
a
and
b
bwyn
[finish]

Any number (greater then zero) of word-parts can be contained between each of the []'d parts. Please note that ALL FOUR of the []'d parts
are required, or your MUD will most likely crash. :)

The word-parts are formed into names by randomly selecting one from each section. Based on the example file above, some sample names that
can be formed include: Abaeb, Adarebwyn, etc. (Obviously these aren't terribly good names, but it is somewhat of a limited example. A real 
file would have many more combinations.)

This file should be located in the system/ directory.

Thats it for the file format section.



Mobile Setup

In order to tell a mobile to utilise the random name code, mobs should be mset name namegen_example

Similarly, any occurances of the word namegen (note that this should really be namegen, not namegen_example) in the short and long 
descriptions of the mobile will be replaced with the mobiles new name.

Thats it for the mobile setup section.

You should now have randomly named mobiles in your MUD. 

Thank you for using the AFKMud codebase, and if you have any problems with either the codebase, or these directions, please feel free to
