=== The #AREADATA section (also referred to as the header)

Last Modified by Samson, Nov. 26, 2014

If a <value> or string literal field is followed by a ~, then that ~ marker is required there.
Tags with a # in front are required, and must appear in the order in which they are specified.
Value fields without a # in front are generally optional and default values will be used by
the code if nothing is specified.

The syntax of this section is:

#AFKAREA
--------
String literal. Required to identify new area format.

#AREADATA
---------
String literal. Identifies the start of the header section.

Version     <int>
-----------------
Numerical value > 0. This determines which area version this file is supposed to be handled as.
The version number will only need to be raised under special circumstances since the overall
area format is very tolerant of adding and/or removing data fields.

Name        <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the area.

Author      <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the person who wrote the area.

Credits     <string>~
---------------------
String containing additional credits data as desired.

Vnums       <int> <int>
-----------------------
Pair of numerical values. The first int is the low vnum, second int is the high vnum.

Continent   <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the continent this area is a part of.

Coordinates <int> <int>
-----------------------
Numerical values containing the X,Y coordinates of this area on the overland map it belongs to.
Overland usage is not required, and these values can both be set to 0 if they will not be needed.

Dates       <time> <time>
-------------------------
Numerical values representing the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.
Commonly known as "unix time". Generally these values will be set up automatically in the code.
You can use the conversion tool at http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm to get the numbers.
The first one is the date the area file was first created.
The second one is the date the area file was installed into the live player port.
If left as zeros, they will work, but will report both dates as being the current date and time.

Ranges      <int> <int> <int> <int>
-----------------------------------
Series of numerical values. In order: Low soft, high soft, low hard, and high hard.
These values are the level enforcement settings for the area. The soft range is not code enforced
and are displayed on the "areas" command as recommended levels. The hard range is code enforced and
anyone not meeting the range boundaries will not be able to enter this area.

ResetMsg    <string>~
---------------------
String containing a message to be sent to all player occupants when the area resets.

ResetFreq   <int>
-----------------
Numerical value > 0. This is the time in minutes it will take for the area to reset.

Flags       <string> <string> <string> <...>~
---------------------------------------------
One or more string values representing the flags that are set on this area. Flags can be chosen from the following table,
and affect every room in the area when applied. These flags override flags of the same type which are set on individual
rooms.

The following flags are available to set on areas:

Flag       | Details
-----------+--------------------------------------
nopkill    | Player killers cannot enter this area.
nocamp     | Camping is not allowed in this area.
noastral   | Astral Walk spells will not function in this area.
noportal   | Portal spells will not function in this area.
             Players also cannot make portals to this area from elsewhere.
norecall   | Recall spells will not function in this area.
nosummon   | Summoning magic will not function in this area.
noscry     | Scrying magic does not function in this area.
             Players in other rooms cannot scry into this area either.
noteleport | Teleportation magic will not work in this area.
             Players also cannot teleport here from other locations.
nobeacon   | Player cannot use the beacon spell in this area.
noquit     | Players cannot quit in this area.
nowhere    | Players in areas flagged with this will not show up
             on the "where" command list.
silence    | No speech can take place in this area.
nomagic    | Magic does not function in this area.
arena      | An arena. Players may fight each other for sport here.
             This requires administrative approval in a finished zone.
hidden     | The area will not be shown on the public area list.
prototype  | This area is a prototype.
             The prototype flag should only be found on unfinished areas.

Treasure <val1> <val2> <val3> <val4> <val5> <val6> <val7> <val8>
----------------------------------------------------------------
These set the random chances of generating a certain type of random
treasure for this area. If this section is left out, the code will
adpot some default settings based on the original hardcoded formulas.

<val1> is the chance to generate nothing at all.
<val2> is the chance to generate some gold.
<val3> is the chance to generate a random item, which is further broken
down by <val5> through <val8>
<val4> is the chance to generate a gem.
Runes are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings runes will not be generated at all for this area.

<val5> is the chance to generate a random scroll.
<val6> is the chance to generate a random potion.
<val7> is the chance to generate a random wand.
<val8> is the chance to generate a random armor, which may have item sockets
for rune insertion.
Weapons are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings, weapons will not be generated at all for this area.
Further, weapons can also randomly be assigned item sockets for rune insertion.

Climate     <value1> <value2> <value3>
--------------------------------------
Numerical values indicating climate factors which have been set on the area.
These values affect the severity of weather within the zone. More information on
this will be available when we understand it all better. Or better yet, refer to
the online helpfiles. They probably explain it fairly well.

The <value1> setting is the temperature range, <value2> is the precipitation,
and <value3> is the wind. Refer to the following tables.

Value1 | Temperature   Value2 | Precipitation   Value3 | Wind
--------------------   ----------------------   ----------------
    0  | Cold               0 | Arid                 0 | Still
    1  | Cool               1 | Dry                  1 | Calm
    2  | Normal             2 | Normal               2 | Normal 
    3  | Warm               3 | Damp                 3 | Breezy
    4  | Hot                4 | Wet                  4 | Windy

Neighbor     <string>~
----------------------
The name of a neighboring area which affects this area's weather patterns.
There can be multiple neighbor lines in an area header.
