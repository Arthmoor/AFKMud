=== The #AREADATA section (also referred to as the header)

Last Modified by Samson, Dec. 14, 2006

If a <value> or string literal field is followed by a ~, then that ~ marker is required there.
Tags with a # in front are required, and must appear in the order in which they are specified.
Value fields without a # in front are generally optional and default values will be used by
the code if nothing is specified.

The syntax of this section is:

#AFKAREA
--------
String literal. Required to identify new area format.

#AREADATA
---------
String literal. Identifies the start of the header section.

Version     <int>
-----------------
Numerical value > 0. This determines which area version this file is supposed to be handled as.

Name        <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the area.

Author      <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the person who wrote the area.

Vnums       <int> <int>
-----------------------
Pair of numerical values. The first int is the low vnum, second int is the high vnum.

Continent   <string>~
---------------------
String containing the name of the continent this area is a part of.

Coordinates <int> <int>
-----------------------
Numerical values containing the X,Y coordinates of this area on the overland map it belongs to.
Overland usage is not required, and these values can both be set to 0 if they will not be needed.

Ranges      <int> <int> <int> <int>
-----------------------------------
Series of numerical values. In order: Low soft, high soft, low hard, and high hard.
These values are the level enforcement settings for the area. The soft range is not code enforced
and are displayed on the "areas" command as recommended levels. The hard range is code enforced and
anyone not meeting the range boundaries will not be able to enter this area.

ResetMsg    <string>~
---------------------
String containing a message to be sent to all player occupants when the area resets.

ResetFreq   <int>
-----------------
Numerical value > 0. This is the time in minutes it will take for the area to reset.

Flags       <string> <string> <string> <...>~
---------------------------------------------
One or more string values representing the flags that are set on this area. Flags can be chosen from the following table,
and affect every room in the area when applied. These flags override flags of the same type which are set on individual
rooms.

FLAG NAME     | DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
nopkill	      | No Pkillers are allowed in this zone.
nocamp        | Players cannot camp anywhere in this zone.
noastral      | Players may not astral walk from or to this zone.
noportal      | Players may not portal to or from this zone.
norecall      | Players may not recall from this zone.
nosummon      | Players may not summon to or from this zone.
noscry        | Players may not use the farsight spell in this zone.

nobeacon      | Players may not set recall beacons in this zone.
noquit        | Players may not quit while in this area.

Climate     <value1> <value2> <value3>
--------------------------------------
Numerical values indicating climate factors which have been set on the area.
These values affect the severity of weather within the zone. More information on
this will be available when we understand it all better. Or better yet, refer to
the online helpfiles. They probably explain it fairly well.

The <value1> setting is the temperature range, <value2> is the precipitation,
and <value3> is the wind. Refer to the following tables.

Value1 | Temperature   Value2 | Precipitation   Value3 | Wind
--------------------   ----------------------   ----------------
    0  | Cold               0 | Arid                 0 | Still
    1  | Cool               1 | Dry                  1 | Calm
    2  | Normal             2 | Normal               2 | Normal 
    3  | Warm               3 | Damp                 3 | Breezy
    4  | Hot                4 | Wet                  4 | Windy

Treasure <val1> <val2> <val3> <val4> <val5> <val6> <val7> <val8>
----------------------------------------------------------------
These set the random chances of generating a certain type of random
treasure for this area. If this section is left out, the code will
adpot some default settings based on the original hardcoded formulas.

<val1> is the chance to generate nothing at all.
<val2> is the chance to generate some gold.
<val3> is the chance to generate a random item, which is further broken
down by <val5> through <val8>
<val4> is the chance to generate a gem.
Runes are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings runes will not be generated at all for this area.

<val5> is the chance to generate a random scroll.
<val6> is the chance to generate a random potion.
<val7> is the chance to generate a random wand.
<val8> is the chance to generate a random armor, which may have item sockets
for rune insertion.
Weapons are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings, weapons will not be generated at all for this area.
Further, weapons can also randomly be assigned item sockets for rune insertion.

Neighbor     <string>~
----------------------
The name of a neighboring area which affects this area's weather patterns.
There can be multiple neighbor lines in an area header.
