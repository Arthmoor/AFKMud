Bug Fixes:

	The act_prog word list bug was fixed.
	Two crash bugs.  Both were caused by a MOBProged mob dieing as
		a result of its or others entry_prog and greet_prog.

Changes:

	New INSTALL for MERC 2.0 and above.
	Updated DOC.
	Slightly rewritten mob_prog file.
	Slightly rewritten mob_commands file matching wiz commands in
		act_wiz.c.
	Instead of having coders change all their act () from act ()
		to safe_act(), I've provided for a global boolean
		called MOBtrigger.

Needs to be done:

	It would be nice to have a speech_prog type trigger for the other
communication channels.  I've had so little time, I've let this idea slip
through my hands.  So, I'm going to pass the buck to a more enterprising
implimentor with more time on his/her hands.


	This MOBPrograms2.1 is written for MERC 2.1 or upcoming MERC 2.2
I have done nothing more than make the code easier to read/squashed a couple
of bugs/redid the INSTALL and DOC files.
	I wish you all well in your endevours.  MERC Industries has
been dissolved and MERC 2.2 will be the last installment.  Bugs/ideas/fixes/etc
regarding MERC 1.0/2.0/2.1/2.2 should now be forwarded to the merc mailing
list (merc@kpc.com).  Bugs regarding the MOBProgram code/etc should be
forwarded to either the list or John Murphy at murph@cs.cmu.edu.  Thank you
for your support and enthusiasm.  The end of our development is the beginning
of yours.....
