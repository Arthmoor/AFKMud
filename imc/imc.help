which accompanied the source code for IMC2. Besides, the list is a bit large to put here.

A password provided by the owner of the hub is required to use these commands. If your mud

Text Syntax: imcchanlist               - list all known IMC channels
        imcchanlist (channel)     - list details on one IMC channel

IMCCHANLIST displays information on channels active on IMC.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Perm    Policy
Hub01:ichat     ichat           Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
Hub01:icode     icode           Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
Hub01:pchat     pchat           Paradigm@Pabulu Mort    Open
Hub01:bridge1   ibchat          Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
hub00:music     mchat           Xorith@SOR-Live Mort    Open
hub01:admin     iadmin          Paradigm@Pabulu Admin   Private
Hub00:00Haven   (not local)     Xorith@SOR-Live Imp     Private

This shows the channel's network name (eg. Hub01:ichat), the local name
 eg ichat - which can be used as an abbreviation in IMCSETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel
(eg. Paradigm@Pabulum), and the channel's policy.

Channel policies available are: open, and private.

Open channels can be seen and used by anyone meeting the mud's minimum level for IMC2.
Private channels can only be seen and used by the list of invited users.

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC2, it
will have an Unknown flag on it.

IMCCHANLIST with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel Hub01:ichat:
  Local name: ichat
  Regformat : [ichat] %s: %s
  Emformat  : [ichat] %s %s
  Socformat : [ichat] %s
  Perms     : Imm

  Policy    : Open -- Open to all muds
  Owner     : Paradigm@Pabulum
  Operators : remcon@pabulum paradigm@pabulum
  Invited   : 
  Excluded  : 

This displays the channel name, local name, policy and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- The minimum permissions needed on your mud to see the channel.

- The format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc that your mud uses.

  Regformat is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Emformat is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their 
  name, the second %s the text of their emote.

  Socformat is a similar string for emotes. Except there is only one %s and
  is the format used to send socials to the network.

- Any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the IMCSETUP command.

- The invited and excluded people on the channel.

IMCCOMMAND is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
IMCCOMMAND list (nodename) for public commands, or IMCCOMMAND list
(node:channel) to see what commands you have for that channel.

IMCCOMMAND create creates a new channel, with you as the owner.

IMCCOMMAND destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

IMCCOMMAND policy changes the basic policy of the channel. You must be the owner.

IMCCOMMAND addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

IMCCOMMAND invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the 
channel. Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be 
specified.

The IMCIGNORE command blocks all messages specifically directed toward an
individual user and is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify individual users, or an entire mud using wildcards like so:

imcignore pest@mud
imcignore *@mud
imcignore pest@*

Before going to the mud's administration with a complaint, try this first.
If the particular person you are attempting to ignore continues to cause
problems or is becoming a nuisance to the mud in general, advise your mud
administration to seek the use of an IMCBAN command against them.
Be prepared to justify this with a good reason and provide any documentation
of any incidents your administrators ask for.

The IMCBAN command is used to stop an individual user, or an entire
mud from sending any traffic to your mud at all. This is your second line
of defense in the event individual user-level ignores fail to do the job
adequately for you. This is a somewhat drastic measure and should only be
used in elevated cases. In general it is best to have documented cases of
problems with individual users on your mud before resorting to this. All
incoming traffic from the offending mud is simply dropped and no further
action taken on the packets. If this level of action fails to stop the
problems you are having, document the incidents and proceed to the next
level and seek assistance from the hub administrator of the hub you are
connected to. They will be able to direct you further, and can issue
bans at the hub or network level if need be.

IMCSETUP socformat (localname) (format)   - change channel social format

IMCSETUP allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

IMCSETUP setlocal configures a channel. It connects the specified channel
(of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.

For example: IMCSETUP setlocal Hub:IMCChat imcchat. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is configured, default values are filled in for
regformat, emoteformat, socformat and level.

IMCSETUP delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

IMCSETUP rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

IMCSETUP regformat, emoteformat and socformat change how a channel is 
displayed locally. Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it,
except socformat, (this is checked for) - the first will be replaced by the 
speaker's name, the second by whatever they say or do. Regformat is used for 
normal speech, emoteformat is for emotes and socformat is for socials.

IMCSETUP level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.
