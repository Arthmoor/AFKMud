Head: The stuff you want above the list of players when they are parsed.
Charline: What one line for a character should look like when parsed.
Immline: What one line for an immortal should look like when parsed.
Tail: The stuff you want below the list of players when they are parsed.
Master: The global template, where you should stick everything in the order you want.

Head, Charline, and Tail should all be terminated with a ¢ at the point where the
section should end.

Head and Tail can contain any of the following:

<%mudfullname%> = Where to put the MUD's full name - parsed at boot/refresh
<%mudtelnet%> = The line containing the MUD's telnet address - parsed at boot/refresh
<%mudport%> = Where to put the MUD's telnet port - parsed at boot/refresh
<%mudurl%> = Format for the section containing the MUD's URL - parsed at boot/refresh
<%plrcount%> = Where to put the player count

Charline and Immline can contain any of the following:

<%charrank%> = Location on a line for a person's rank
<%charflags%> = Location on a line for a person's statflags
<%charname%> = Location on a line for a person's name
<%chartitle%> = Location on a line for a person's title

Master should contain a marker to designate the head, charline, and tail sections:

<%head%> = Where to put everything in your Head: section.
<%plrline%> = Where to put character lines.
<%immline%> = Where to put immortal lines.
<%tail%> = Where to put everything in your Tail: section.

<%plrheader%> = The line it displays for the "players" header
<%immheader%> = The line it displays for the "immortals" header

plrline and immline will contain multiple entries based on how many of each are on.

Other stuff:

<center> = Directive to cause a line to be centered for 80 column display. Only works on whole lines.

Color is done using the native IMC2 color system which uses tildes (~) before a color tag.
If your template calls for displaying an actual tilde, it needs to be escaped, like so: ~~

When terminating a section, the ¢ symbol is required. Leaving it out or chaging it will cause you much headache.
If you can't generate this symbol from your keyboard, cut and paste it into place.
If you need multiple lines in a section, just press enter when editing. The code will load them up as is.

An example template:

Head: <center>~R-=[ ~WPlayers on <%mudfullname%> ~R]=-
<center>~Y-=[ ~Wtelnet://<%mudtelnet%>:<%mudport%> ~Y]=-¢

Tail: ~Y[~WPlayers online: <%plrcount%>~Y] ~Y[~WHomepage: <%mudurl%>~Y]¢

Plrline: <%charrank%>~z[<%charflags%>]~G <%charname%><%chartitle%>¢

Immline: <%charrank%>~z[<%charflags%>]~G <%charname%><%chartitle%>¢

Plrheader: ~B-------------------------------=[ ~WPlayers ~B]=--------------------------------¢

Immheader: ~R-------------------------------=[ ~WImmortals ~R]=--------------------------------¢

Master:
<%head%>

<%plrheader%>

<%plrline%>
<%immheader%>

<%immline%>
