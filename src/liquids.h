 ****************************************************************************
 *  (v1.0) - Liquidtable converted into linked list, original 15 Smaug liqs *
 *           now read from a .dat file in /system                           *
 *  (v1.5) - OLC support added to create, edit, and delete liquids while    *
 *           the game is still running, automatic edit.                     *
 *  (v2.0) - Mixture support code added. Liquids can now be mixed with      *
 *           other liquids to form a result.                                *
 *  (v2.2) - Liquid statistics command added (liquids) shows all information*
 *           about the given liquid.                                        *
 *  (v2.3) - OLC addition for mixtures.                                     *
 *  (v2.4) - Mixtures are now saved into a seperate file and one linked list*
 *           because of some saving and loading issues. All the code has    *
 *           been modified to accept the new format. "liq_can_mix" function *
 *           introduced. "mix" command introduced to mix liquids.           *
 *  (v2.5) - Thanks to Samson for some polishing and bugfixing, we now have *
 *           a (hopefully) fully funcitonal copy =).                        *
 *  (v2.6) - "Fill" and "Empty" functions have been fixed to allow for the  *
 *           new liquidsystem.                                              *
 *  (v2.7) - Forgot to fix blood support... fixed.                          *
 *         - IS_VAMPIRE ifcheck placed in do_drink                          * 
 *  	   - Blood fix for blood on the ground.                               *
 *         - do_look/do_exam fix from Sirek.                                *
 *  (v2.8) - Ability to mix objects into liquids.                           *
 *	     (original code/concept -Sirek)                                      *

 * Description:
 * This module is a rewrite of the original module which allowed for
 * a SMAUG mud to have a fully online editable liquidtable; adding liquids;
 * removing them; and editing them online. It allows an near-endless supply
 * of liquids for builder's to work with.
 * A second addition to this module allowed for builder's to create mixtures;
 * when two liquids were mixed together they would produce a different liquid.
 * Yet another adaptation to the above concept allowed for objects to be mixed
 * with liquids to produce a liquid.
 * This newest version offers a cleaner running code; smaller; and faster in
 * all ways around. Hopefully it'll knock out the old one ten fold ;)
 * Also in the upcoming 'testing' phase of this code; new additions will be added
 * including a better alchemey system for creating poitions as immortals; and as
 * mortals.
