just over the horizon, turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold
and black reflections.  A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.
You hear the roar of the waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below,
interspersed with cries of seagulls floating lazily overhead.

than Bywater, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
