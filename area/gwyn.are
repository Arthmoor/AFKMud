say the form of a series of symbols that tell you what type of terrain
say you are travelling on. It works best if your ANSI is turned on, as
say some terrain types use the same symbols with different colors to

say direction is any of the direction of movement possible and distance
say is an integer value indicating the number of squares you want to

say in the given direction till you run out of movement points (not a

ExDesc       The history of Alsherok begins in the village of Graecia, a place whose
origins are shrouded with uncertainty.  Lacking any historical records,
a common tale that travels many hearths is the one that states Graecia
as being founded by nomadic tribes that sought the peace and stability
of a fixed home. Once established, it rapidly became a focus point for
all trade in the region, a place for congregation even amongst the
nomads.  However, many also settled, bringing about the rapid growth and
an urge for exploration that years of settled life had not driven out of
their blood.  The then Council of Elders argued against ideas of
exploration, preferring the semi-isolated state they had currently, but
the majority favored exploration.  Subsequently, the explorers left
under the leadership of Panteleimon.

ExDesc       Almost immediately, the group ran into trouble, encountering a race of
Frost Giants to the north that goaded the aggressive mind of
Panteleimon.  Attempts at negotiations failed, due to inability to
communicate, but primarily because neither side was willing to set aside
the differences.  It is said that the war between the Graecians and the
Frost Giants erupted at the conference table itself, resulting in
Panteleimons death.  The troops retreated rapidly, overwhelmed by sheer
numbers, but with reinforcements, the Frost Giants were kept in the
north while Fort Deme was established.  A watchpost against the Giants,
it stands to this day overlooking the Arctic Wastes.  This unfortunate
excursion and the resulting war served to curb any remaining urge for
exploration, and Graecia remained isolated for a while longer.

ExDesc       Over the years, simple excursions were made, and Graecia grew to greater
proportions, developing a steady economy that was largely trade-based.
The Guilds and trade associations were first founded here, formed on the
basis of mutual interests.  One such group that arose from these Guilds
was the group that referred to themselves as the Wako.  They were drawn
to the criminal side of society, attracted by the endless possibilities
that the city offered in terms of wealth.  They soon overran the city,
almost turning into a plague that fed upon the citizens.  Out of fear of
the repercussions on the economy, the King gathered an army against the
Wako, and after a brief sortie with them, expelled them into the south.
Rumors say that they have vanished in the general direction of the
ocean.

ExDesc       Not long after the expulsion of the Wako, the King sent out scouts to
establish the precise location of the Wako.  Headed southwards, the
scouts failed to encounter any Wako, but instead discovered a massive
palace atop the ancient Black Mountains.  While tales had always
abounded about the evil nature of the Black Mountains, the palace that
had suddenly appeared took everyone by surprise.   Spies were
immediately sent out to determine the exact nature of the inhabitants of
the Black Mountains, and only a scant five returned with news of the
evil Lord that had taken control of the area.  While the news of an evil
Lord from another dimension filled the King with dread, the scouts also
brought welcome news that the Lord was trapped within the palace by a
strange magical barrier that defied the imaginations of the human mages.

ExDesc       The success of the scouting mission soon renewed interest in
exploration, and prompted by the formation of Guilds and associations
within Graecia, the Guild of Cartographers was formed.  At its helm was
a well-traveled and wise adventurer called Aristeides, who despite his
youth, gathered many of his fellow wanderers and began the extensive
exploration of the immediate areas.  Travelling further south from the
Black Mountain, they soon discovered the existence of a large river,
headed west towards the ocean.  A short distance from the river, the
Guild also found, much to their horror, a land route that traced its
path up to the dreaded Lord Arthmoors Palace.  Previously undiscovered
by the scouts, the Guild immediately reported back to the new King with
the news, and anxiously waited for his commands.  Advised with caution
from his advisors and from his fathers words, the new King commissioned
the construction of her second fortress, Fort Balasi.  Thus it is, to
this day, that the walls of Fort Balasi stands on silent watch over the
southern border from the eventual day of conflict between Lord Arthmoor
and Graecia.

ExDesc       Although the minimal explorations before the discovery of the land route
had discovered traces of other races within the lands, all exploration
came to a standstill while Fort Balasi was constructed.  Now, with the
border secure, the Cartographers Guild had the leisure to explore even
further.  It turned out that a small settlement of Dwarves had made
their home just south of the Black Mountains, mining out what little
resources they could find.  Rather cursory by nature, they bluntly
informed the Cartographers Guild, and through them, the King of
Graecia, that they would welcome whatever trade could be spared, but it
really wasnt necessary.  Of course, trade relations were begun almost
instantaneously, but the only real thing garnered from these relations
were the skills of mining and smithing, with which Graecia propelled
itself into further growth.  Once things were running smoothly in the
Dwarven settlements, the restless Cartographers Guild left to explore
the river that flowed just past the settlements.

ExDesc       The River Branduin, named for the leader of scouts who had returned from
Lord Arthmoors, proved too wide to cross easily, thus when explorations
continued, Aristeides led his party along the eastern banks into a
massive forest now known collectively as the Great Haon Dor Forest.
Attention was quickly drawn to the largest tree that the adventurers had
ever seen.  For as long as they had lived tales of this giant tree had
circulated amongst the known world, and they were eager to explore this
new find.  However, the Elves that had made residence in the tree were
insistent that they leave, and not wishing to press the issue,
Aristeides led his party further east, into the Haon Dor Forest.  Almost
by chance, they came upon a community of incredibly swift creatures whom
they dubbed as Quicklings.  Their leader, Tephanis, grew incensed at
this apparent violation of his borders and immediately ordered an all
out attack.  The battle did not last long, and the Quicklings returned
to their tree homes, ever watchful of newcomers to the forest.

ExDesc       After their departure, Aristeides continued exploration along a more
cautious vein.  Their exploration was rewarded when they discovered a
much more friendly race of elves that valued knowledge.  They were eager
to establish relations on a more permanent basis, and trade routes were
soon established.  Their scholars were also glad to share whatever
information they had on the forest and the immediate area.  In
particular, they revealed that there was a village of Halflings nearby.
Before they left in search of the Halflings, Queen Calandra of the
Elves, in a token of appreciation to the Cartographers Guild,
commissioned the construction of a Guildhall for Aristeides and his
fellow travelers to serve as a base camp for any future explorations
that they might undertake.

ExDesc       Pressing on further after several weeks of rest, Aristeides and his
Guild members soon found the Halfling Shire, and once again friendly
relations were established.  The Mayor of the Halfling Shire, with
little persuasion, signed a defense and trade pact with the group on
behalf of the King of Graecia.  Upon the news of a friendly Halfling
town, the current King of Graecia, Callimachus gladly ratified the
treaty and formed the Graecian Confederation.  The Dwarven settlements,
approached with the same offer, refused it as politely as they could.
However, Queen Calandra was quick to agree, and a tri-party treaty was
signed.  Soon, a small trading post was constructed along a forest trail
outside the Shire, called Perioeci.  As time passed, the Confederation
settled down to a period of much growth, development, and peace.  Along
with the new alliance, the Halflings founded a mine in the mountains
north of the city and vast amounts of gold began to trickle into the
Confederation, benefiting the both the Shire and Confederation.

ExDesc       With a new era dawning in relationships between the various races, a
band of nine legendary heroes, famed for their exploits against the evil
forces, traveled to the southern part of the world. There they rallied
the goodly races of the land, especially the Humans and the Half-Elven
kind, to build a city of immense beauty. Because the world had just
entered an age of peace, this new city stood as a bastion of hope and
friendship for all goodly races in the land. From all around the world,
the peoples of the land came to help the nine heroes build the city.
Elves from their citadel, Dwarves from their mountain, Halflings from
their towns, Gnomes from their underground caverns and even other Humans
from far away cities all came together to forge a new friendship. In
just under two years, the city was complete! From then on, city was
known as Palainth, the city of Magic. It is said that the Goddess of
Magic herself, Laeral Dayspring was one of the nine who founded the
city. She traveled with them in the guise of her Half-Elven avatar.
Thus, the citizens of Palainth regard her as their patron goddess and
have built a garden within Palainth as a tribute to her.  She also
became an unofficial member of the Graecian Confederation, contributing
to the great trade that traced its way across the Alsherok continent.

ExDesc       As the years passed and the Graecian Confederation settled down to a
period of prosperity, news soon reached the ears of new, undiscovered
lands to the east.  Under commission by the King, Elutherios, the new
head of the Cartographers Guild, led his band of adventurers into the
east to seek out these new lands.  Much to their delight, they
discovered a small village of humans called Midgaard.  Entranced by the
possibility of bring another nation into the Graecian Confederation,
they eagerly issued the proposal on behalf of the King.  After much
deliberation, Midgaard refused to sign the treaty that would bring it
into the Graecian Confederation, but made it clear that it would welcome
trade.  Despite being disappointed by the lack of interest on Midgaards
part, the Graecian King agreed to allow trade relations to continue, but
remained wary of his eastern neighbors, as the Guild brought back news
of the recklessness of those in Midgaard.

ExDesc       As the trade between the Graecian Confederation and Midgaard grew, the
wealth and resources that flowed into Midgaard transformed the village
into large city, surpassing even Graecia itself.  It soon gained a
reputation as a vibrant and prosperous city, and was commonly referred
to as the Jewel of the East.  Eventually, to help facilitate trade and
to encourage still more trade, the King of Midgaard sent out a noble
called Lord Argalath to establish a trading base within the Graecian
Confederation itself.  The long trek from Midgaard to Graecia was thus
made easier, and trade soared during those early years.  But the peace
and prosperity that followed was not to last, for evil omens were
apparent everywhere one looked
bad times were upon their cherished
land.

ExDesc       Trade, what little that continued into the south, came to an abrupt
standstill as the Dwarven settlements had all been deserted. There had
been no explanation given, just a complete disappearance on the part of
the Dwarves.  In the last effective excursion by the Cartographers
Guild, it was roughly determined that they had packed up, and fled east
in a rush, not bothering to cover what little tracks they laid.  The
Guild tried to catch up, mounting the best horses offered by Fort
Balasi, but the trail was lost within the thick forests and falling
snow.  Returning to the settlements, a more through examination
revealing nothing of their purpose in leaving east, and in much
frustration, returned to their Guild Hall, worried over the illness
their Guild leader had caught while embroiled in this scouting attempt.

ExDesc       Troubles first began in the mines, where a band of Jermlaine drove the
bewildered Halflings out of their mines, claiming it as their own.
Before the Halflings could even begin to regroup, the Jermlaine set
traps within the mines, entrapping anyone who dared venture into their
newfound territory. Helpless against such a wily and ruthless foe, the
Halflings abandoned the mines to deal with more pressing problems in the
east. A band of Orcs had grown restless further east of Midgaard, and
the King thought it an opportune moment to quell any chances of
expansion by the Orcs, thus striking first without warning. However,
that proved to be a mistake, as both sides suffered heavy losses.
Conflict tapered down as the heavy winter chill set in, and an uneasy
peace settled upon the lands.

ExDesc       Deep into mid winter, it became apparent that communication was not
forthcoming from Lord Argalath and similarly, all Midgaard merchants
that frequented the Keep went missing.  Any attempts by the Graecian
Confederation or Midgaard to establish contact failed as their scouting
parties followed the footsteps of the merchants and vanished.  The
Cartographers Guild also failed to act decisively during this period as
the death of Elutherios threw the entire Guild into disarray.  With the
passing of their leader, their once proud Guild faded into the annals of
history, as did the Guildhall, which was slowly reclaimed by nature.

ExDesc       Following these events came a decision that confirmed the suspected
reckless nature of Midgaard Kings.  Midgaard declared an all out war
upon the Orcs, urged on by a particularly aggressive Council and
immature King.  The losses reached new heights, virtually robbing
Midgaard of all their able-bodied warriors.  The Orcs seemed to flow
like an inexhaustible tide to overrun the lands, and soon, Midgaard
resorted to fighting a defensive war.  Slowly but steadily, they lost
more and more lands, and they themselves began to realize the folly of
their decision.  Graecia, at first only mildly concerned, soon found
themselves stepping up military patrols along the eastern border, hoping
that the warfront would not advance, but not holding out much hope for
it.  Palainth, seeing the desperate situation Midgaard was in, sent
forces to aid against the Orcish hordes, hoping to prevent what could
erupt into a war of immense proportions, but as it turned out, it was
unable to do anything worthwhile.

ExDesc       Finally, out of sheer desperation and fatalism, a small detachment of
Midgaards finest warriors were sent into the mountains north of the
city in an attempt to gather aid for their falling city.  Tales had
abounded about fierce Dragons that dwelt in those mountains, and it was
hoped that with the aid of magiks, these Dragons could be turned into a
force that would challenge the might of the Orcs.  Unfortunately, once
the Dragons were brought into the skies of Midgaard, they broke the
inadequate binding magiks worked upon them, and promptly laid waste to
the area as a symbol of their anger.  The skies that day were red with
the unnatural heat of stone burning, and none of all those that lived
within the city and in its immediate surroundings were left alive.
Then, just as swiftly as it had begun, the Dragons vanished into the
sky, never to be seen again.

the Orcs that lurked in waiting.  Anything was better than facing the
Dragons wrath again.
With determination, the survivors set about rebuilding their lives,
starting with the building of a new city, Maldoth.  Although cut off
from the rest of the world by the extensive destruction the Orcs
wrought, the citizens knew that the lands to the east still lay open to
them, and life would still go on.

ExDesc       On the other hand, the Orcs, seeing a prime opportunity, advanced upon
the borders of Graecia.  Despite all their precautions, the troops were
swarmed under by the vast number of Orcs.  Shire was the first to fall.
Reinforcements that arrived were too late to save the Halfling town, but
they were able to make a stand at the edge of River Branduin, managing
to save the Elven City from imminent destruction, though it cost more
lives than the King cared to count.  Subsequently, the Graecian King
also ordered Perioeci upgraded into a fully defensive fortress, hoping
that this would serve to stem the tide of Orcs that flowed across the
lands.

ExDesc       While this was enough to prevent extensive incursions into the northern
regions, this was not so for the City of Palainth.  In the south, they
were open to attacks from the Orcs, who had no qualms about doing so.
Ever since Palainths interference in Midgaards war with the Orcs, the
Orcs have regarded them as an enemy to be vanquished and tried all means
and ways to eradicate her and her inhabitants.  Her greatest battle
against the might of evil is recorded as the battle between the citizens
and attacking hordes of Demons.  A rift in the void allowed the Demons
to escape from their dwelling place, but it is still unknown as whether
the Orcs had caused the rift to appear.  Nevertheless, with their adept
balance in using both the sword and sorcery to defend their city, they
withstood the onslaught for three days, while their mages worked
furiously to find means and ways to return the demons to their
dimension.  At last, they succeeded, and the weary citizens of Palainth
banished the demons from the world.  But the threat still lingers, as
Demons have eternal life and they but wait the chance to return and
destroy the city.

ExDesc       The following years after Palainths battle, while not exactly peaceful, 
were predictable, and the lives of the peasants carried on.  However, 
with the death of his father, King Agamemnon ascended the throne of 
Graecia.  A ruthless imperialist, he bent all his resources towards 
world conquest.  To facilitate his desire, he ordered the building of a 
massive brick road between Graecia and Bywater, the newly rebuilt 
Halfling city.  The military was tripled in size, and intense training 
marked the Graecian forces that were slowly mounting up against the 
Orcs.  Full-time garrisons were soon stationed in all three forts, and 
reserves were mustered up to serve as additional border guards.  Each 
garrison soon became the dominion of the armys finest warriors, and
with their help, Agamemnon tightened his grip over the Confederation and 
rechristened it as The Graecian Empire.  In addition to the boosting of 
existing forces, Agamemnon decided that a new fort would be needed in 
the continuing fight against the Orcs.  Thus it came to be that he 
ordered the construction of Fort Palaestras at the base of the mountain 
pass that led upwards to Bywater.  This was a fortunate move, as 
scouting missions were to prove.  The first scout mission returned 
shortly after they left, bearing with them the news that Orcs had 
constructed their own fort on the opposite end of the pass.  The news 
greatly angered Agamemnon, and he immediately called up all the reserves 
he could muster and doubled the garrison at Fort Palaestras.  The
Halflings, leery of further threat to their newly rebuilt city, 
volunteered an auxiliary group of their best Slingers to aid in manning 
the garrison, the first time a fortress within the empire was staffed by 
more than just humans.  Further scouting missions undertaken revealed 
that the Orcs called their fort Gulghack, but they were unable to 
acertain any further information of use.

ideals of peace and trust
rather, she stood alone, isolated in the 
south, against those few Orcish hordes that still ventured against them, 
offering protection and help to those who needed it.  Agamemnon, while 
far from happy at this, agreed to let them go, as they had never 
officially signed a treaty to join the Confederation.

wealth than before, and channeled it into the building of a navy that
would transverse the oceans that formed the western border.  Their
efforts at navigation were soon rewarded with the discovery of a small
island, and it was decided that a colony should be established as a last
resort, and the Ventorium Colony was born.  Not long after the
establishment of the colony, further explorations upon the islands led
them to a town populated by Balericans.  Several overtures were made
towards the town, but it remained largely isolated, and the Graecians
abandoned their attempts at communication.  Soon, more and more citizens
of Graecia traveled over to their new colony to flee the encroaching
forces of the Orcs.

the city to begin.  Within years, what had seemed an impossible task was
completed, and New Graecia was born upon the ruins of the old.  However,
that first earthquake was but a hint of what lay in store, for as the
years passed, earthquakes still ravaged the lands, and the forest was
scarred beyond repair.  What people that dared venture out into new
territories reported vast caverns that had been opened up beneath the
mighty forest, and as yet, little is known of what they contain. It was

the disasters opened up the Bloodmire Swamp on the trading routes that
had marked the way to the City of Righteousness.

still reigns in the lands, but the Light glows yet within the Dark, and

ExDesc       Even as Maldoth was completed, new contacts were made with other races.
From deep within the Broken Hills in which Maldoth lay, adventurers
trekked north only to discover the Dwarven stronghold, named Kelgarn.
The Dwarves explained that they had premonitions of the trouble that
would settle upon the land, and had fled the destruction.
Unfortunately, they had also become embroiled with the war with the
Orcs, despite having founded a new stronghold.  While trade relations
were again set up between Kelgarn and Maldoth, the explorers continued
scouting the land.   Further travels saw the naming of the Misty Sea,
this time in the south, and the revelation that a small trading town
existed on its far southern coast.

ExDesc       The worshippers of the old Midgaardish god of knowledge and life,
Mithgilran, were determined to eke out a new life for themselves outside
of Maldoth.  Largely consisting of craftsmen and traders, this group of
survivors were delivered from the ruins of Midgaard by Mithgilran, and
led to the shores of the Misty Sea.  Fertile coastal plains lay open
before them, and the fair town of Greyhaven was born.  Because of their
brush with war and their immense respect for knowledge, they have no
King, but instead follow the teachings of their current scribe, Lorthan.
It was on his advice, that they decided to hold no allegiance to any
empire or city, hard pressed as they are in a world of troubles, and it
has benefited them immensely.

ExDesc       The skilled craftsmen of Greyhaven soon made many sea-worthy vessels and
numbering paramount amongst those were huge trading ships.  With these
ships, exploration was soon under way, and thus it came to pass that the
people of the continent of Alsherok established contact with the people of
the ancient and mystical continent of Eletar.  There they encountered,
for the first time, the culture that was named Eletari.

ExDesc       The Eletari were friendly people, although possessed of dark features
and yellow skin that had not been seen in Alsherok before.  They too, had
their own intensely different culture, but they welcomed the explorers
into their home with equality, and led them to the village of Dragon
Gate as their point of disembarkation.  The village, nestled within the
verdant valleys north of the Dragonhead Bay, proved to be an excellent
choice, as it soon blossomed into a major stopping point along the trade
route between both continents.  Adventurers also ventured further and
further beyond the gates of Dragon Gate, journeying into the far north
to the Imperial City of Chang-An where the Emperor of the Nine Dragon
Pearls, holds court over Eletar.

ExDesc       Even as these new explorations and ventures took place, a clear path was
found linking Palainth back to the rest of the cities of Alsherok.  Trade
relations were soon resumed, and due to its strategic location, it
blossomed into the largest city in the southern parts of the main
continent.  Renowned for their acceptance of all that come in search of
knowledge, regardless of race, this majestic city is frequently visited
by all peoples of the land. They are a city founded and structured on
the tenets of individuality and fairness, where peoples of all races can
find welcome if they come in goodwill. A city of endless splendors,
unrivaled in aesthetic beauty, Palainth exists in open defiance of the
conquerors and tyrants of the world, a place where no one holds claim
over another. People of all good races walk freely here and without
fear, down every road and alleyway on the darkest of nights.  Protection
for all those within its walls comes from the Knights of Palainth, who
are the direct descendents of the citys founders.

you want them to repeat anything they say, merely say the keyword again.

You stand in the Abecedarium, dedicated to Meia, goddess of learning.
Within these holy walls, you will be taught everything a young
adventurer might need to venture forth into the world.
 
Simply walk from room to room by typing the direction in which you wish
to go.
 
To learn, you will have to talk to the tutors. Just &YSAY&D the words
and they will tell you what you wish to know. Although keywords are not
always obvious, they will be highlighted through the Abecedarium in
capital letters.

During your lessons, you may sometimes forget what has been said. If you
wish a repeat, merely say the keywords again. Also, you may type &YSAY REPEAT&D
for them to tell you what topics they teach.

In every room, there will be a map on the wall. It will show your position.
To look at the map, type &YLOOK MAP&D.

                                &R------&D

The Abecedarium is located on the island of Reonn which is a safe enclave
for new adventurers in the world. Until level 10, you will benefit from
having your corpse being transported to you when you die so you do not
need to do a corpse retrieval. Also, you will have access to newbie
areas located on Reonn where you can gain experience to level.
 
Once you have reached level 5, you can attempt the Abecedarium challenge
where you will be rewarded with a weapon on successful completion and be
transported into the city where more adventures await in the lands. At
level 10, you MUST attempt the challenge as you may no longer access the
Abecedarium and the newbie areas.

to floral. It is a cosy shop, and a circle of chairs is arrayed about a
fire blazing merrily in the hearth. Some kind of herbal tea is boiling
in a kettle hanging over the fire, giving off a pleasant aroma. Shelves
containing a variety of coloured potions line the walls. On one of the
wall hangs a drawing of a yellow turtle.

Desc      You stand at the end of an ornate hallway made of coralite, which is
the crystallised form of coral. Reaching out a hand, you find that it
has a grainy texture which sparkles with refracted light. A stairway
leads upward, while three doors made of quartz stand before you. The
north door is carved with the word "High Elf". To the west, you see
the engraving "Human", while the southern door is scribed with "Pixie".
To the east, the hallway stretches onward.

stand on a branch spreading out from the massive bole. Specks of gold

Desc      Intricate velvet tapestries cover the walls within this chamber. Looking
at them, you cannot help but admire them even as you are disgusted by the
sheer horrors they depict. One captures the moment of a sacrifice to
Zeslavin, the spider deity. Yet another shows a furious battle between
the elfkin and a dwarf troop. Cringing inside, you tear your eyes away
from the terrible beauty of the artwork.

five feet. All the furnishing is done on a proportionate scale, which
means that most people would not fit on the tiny stools around the

and polished to a smooth finish. A giant pearl seems to have been sliced
apart for the creation of twin doors, gleaming softly in the dim light.
To the north is inscribed "Ranger" on the door, while southward you see

while on the overland you will encounter random monsters, some of which
may be aggressive. This will not happen on the island, it is protected
by powerful magic to keep you safe on your journey. There will be two

Desc      You are standing at the entrance to the fair village of Gwyn al'Fer,
wherein lies the famed Abecedarium where young adventurers in the world
receive their initiation into the world of adventuring in these lands.
Gwyn al'Fer is dedicated to the goddess Meia and is protected by strong
magic. Its streets are clean and its buildings are all constructed of
white marble in a block-like style. To the west of here is the great
magical archway which leads from Gwyn al'Fer into the overland area of
the island of Reonn.
&BA signboard with the village map pinned on it is standing here.&D

Desc      Three medium sized white marble buildings occupy the eastern end of
this cobblestoned street. There is a kind of small square here and
it seems to be a pretty busy place with people moving in and out of
the three buildings frequently. A sign above the entrance to the
building to the north reads, "&PThe Interracial Enclave&D", while a
sign above the entrance to the almost identical building to the south
reads, "&PThe Hall of Guilds&D". The domed building to the east has a
sign that reads, "&PThe Healing Chamber&D".

many stalls housing a wide variety of horses and ponies of different
breeds, sizes and shades. There seems to be a horse or pony for every
character of whatever size. Fresh stacks of hay are pushed into one
corner while troughs containing drinking water are in another corner.

Desc      This room is rather hot and stuffy as a large forge is belching out fire
in the centre of the room. A marble chimney set above the forge channels
smoke out of the smithy. Surprisingly, the white marble walls seem quite
pristine despite the soot and smoke that must be produced in such a place.
Perhaps some protective magic helps to keep the smithy looking so clean.

Desc      The Bank of Gwyn is quite a small building, forcing you to stand
unpleasantly close to the owner of the bank, a grouchy gnome known as
Kedaoa. Embedded in the far wall is a steel vault door that only a very
small person could climb through. Obviously, the meagre wealth of the bank
is locked away, far from your reach.  The remainder of the room is taken
up by accounting ledgers, and a small desk, with a massive feather pen
sitting next to an ink jar. The sheer size of the feather astounds you, as
you begin to wonder what manner of bird it came from.
