Comlist   say The overland is a vast outdoor area that connects all of the other
say interesting locations in the world. It is presented in
say the form of a series of symbols that tell you what type of terrain
say you are travelling on. It works best if your ANSI is turned on, as
say some terrain types use the same symbols with different colors to
say tell them apart. If you would like to experience the overland,
say feel free to make use of the exit to the west. It will take you
say to Reonn, a protected reserve in the Storm Sea set aside for the

say direction is any of the direction of movement possible and distance
say is an integer value indicating the number of squares you want to
say move on the OVERLAND. If distance is not given, then you will run
say in the given direction till you run out of movement points (not a

Within these holy walls, you will be taught everything a young
adventurer might need to venture forth into Alsherok.
 
Simply walk from room to room by typing the direction in which you wish
to go.
 
To learn, you will have to talk to the tutors. Just &YSAY&D the words
and they will tell you what you wish to know. Although keywords are not
always obvious, they will be highlighted through the Abecedarium in
capital letters.

During your lessons, you may sometimes forget what has been said. If you
wish a repeat, merely say the keywords again. Also, you may type &YSAY REPEAT&D
for them to tell you what topics they teach.

In every room, there will be a map on the wall. It will show your position.
To look at the map, type &YLOOK MAP&D.

                                 &RNOTE
                                &R------&D

The Abecedarium is located on the island of Reonn which is a safe enclave
for new adventurers in Alsherok. Until level 10, you will benefit from
having your corpse being transported to you when you die so you do not
need to do a corpse retrieval. Also, you will have access to newbie
areas located on Reonn where you can gain experience to level.
 
Once you have reached level 5, you can attempt the Abecedarium challenge
where you will be rewarded with a weapon on successful completion and be
transported into Bywater City where more adventures await in the lands. At
level 10, you MUST attempt the challenge as you may no longer access the
Abecedarium and the newbie areas.

the crystallised form of coral. Reaching out a hand, you find that it
has a grainy texture which sparkles with refracted light. A stairway
leads upward, while three doors made of quartz stand before you. The

the engraving "Human", while the southern door is scribed with "Pixie".

Zeslavin, the spider deity. Yet another shows a furious battle between
the elfkin and a dwarf troop. Cringing inside, you tear your eyes away

while on the overland you will encounter random monsters, some of which
may be aggressive. This will not happen on the island, it is protected

Desc      You are standing at the entrance to the fair village of Gwyn al'Fer,
wherein lies the famed Abecedarium where young adventurers in the world
receive their initiation into the world of adventuring in these lands.
Gwyn al'Fer is dedicated to the goddess Meia and is protected by strong
magic. Its streets are clean and its buildings are all constructed of
white marble in a block-like style. To the west of here is the great
magical archway which leads from Gwyn al'Fer into the overland area of
the island of Reonn.

Desc      Three medium sized white marble buildings occupy the eastern end of
this cobblestoned street. There is a kind of small square here and
it seems to be a pretty busy place with people moving in and out of
the three buildings frequently. A sign above the entrance to the
building to the north reads, "&PThe Interracial Enclave&D", while a
sign above the entrance to the almost identical building to the south
reads, "&PThe Hall of Guilds&D". The domed building to the east has a
sign that reads, "&PThe Healing Chamber&D".

Desc      This room is rather hot and stuffy as a large forge is belching out fire
in the centre of the room. A marble chimney set above the forge channels
smoke out of the smithy. Surprisingly, the white marble walls seem quite
pristine despite the soot and smoke that must be produced in such a place.
Perhaps some protective magic helps to keep the smithy looking so clean.

Desc      The Bank of Gwyn is quite a small building, forcing you to stand
unpleasantly close to the owner of the bank, a grouchy gnome known as
Kedaoa. Embedded in the far wall is a steel vault door that only a very
small person could climb through. Obviously, the meagre wealth of the bank
is locked away, far from your reach.  The remainder of the room is taken
up by accounting ledgers, and a small desk, with a massive feather pen
sitting next to an ink jar. The sheer size of the feather astounds you, as
you begin to wonder what manner of bird it came from.
