Desc      This is one of the strange card people you keep seeing around the
garden. His head, arms and legs are covered in tight black clothing, so
that all you can see are his face and hands, where the cloth is cut away.
Upon his body, you see the letter A printed upon two diametrically
opposing corners, with one upside down. Also, a single elaborately
decorated spade is visible on the white card face.

white, and it moves around by squirming its body to push itself along. No
eyes or mouth can be seen, but it probably survives on the leaves in this

bursting forth are a rich, lustrous green, and from the perfection 
therein you surmise that the roses, though white, must have been equally
lovely. Unfortunately, they are covered in generous amounts of red paint.

Desc      Walking about this part of the garden, you glimpse a glint of metal
shining in the distance. As you squint, trying to see the source, you
catch sight of a strange card-man standing on a ladder nearby busily
brushing at the roses with a pot of scarlet paint in hand. He seems to
have no more than two dimensions, and at times when he turns sideways,
you are unable to see more than a thin black line where his body is
supposed to be.

Desc      Standing just beside a large rose tree which has been planted here, you
move carefully so as to avoid getting dripped upon by the wet paint which
flows in a viscous manner off the soft white petals, leaving a trail of
bloody splotches as it moves. The leaves are a vibrant green shade, and
the scent of a light floral perfume wafts in the air.

grass before you, at the base of a tree bursting with scarlet blooms.
Closer examination reveals that the roses have actually been painted,
and that they are not yet dry. The garden stretches out to all other
directions save the east, where you see a tall white fence blocking
your way.

of each tree are a deep, rich green, with nary a touch of brown to be seen.
The roses, however, seem to be in a fairly sad state. If they had been left
in their pristine form, you have no doubt that they would be blossoms of
surpassing beauty. As it is, though, you are hard pressed to admire more
than the sweet floral scent which emanates from the crumpled petals.

walk, you can hear the soft crunching of the green stems underfoot.
However, when you look about, you can see no trace of your passage nor
broken stems. Although you find this a little strange, you quickly
attribute it to the magic of the place.

Desc      At this part of the garden, you come upon a curious sight. The grass 
here has been ground up, as if by the treading of too many feet, and
a shining hilt atop a slender blade protrudes from the earth. Looking
more closely, it seems that it would take no great effort to draw the
sword and make use of it. The fact that so many others have tried and
obviously failed makes no sense to you, since the ground within the
garden is soft and earthy, and dug up quite easily.

Unfortunately, the flowers upon the trees have been ruined irreparably

Desc      You stand at the base of a large rose tree. Oddly, you notice that its
flowers all seem to be dripping blood. Upon closer examination, it
becomes clear that the roses, once a pure white, are actually wet with
paint in a deep carmine shade. Before you can think too much about this,
your eyes take in the vision of a beautifully maintained garden which
spreads out all around you into the distance. A small wooden sign grows
out of the bark here, as if by magic.

ExDesc       The sign seems to have grown out of the tree itself, and you can detect
no carve nor cut in its creation. It says:
                 &PWelcome to the Garden Of Cards&z
 
Below, in smaller letters, you can just make out more words...
  &OIf you are thinking about how such a huge garden could exist in
    the confines of a narrow tower, DON'T. It's magic, remember?&z

Desc      Standing in the middle of a huge rose garden within a tower, you try
looking upward to see a sky. Surprisingly enough, there is one, and the
weather is that of a lovely spring morning. Fluffy white clouds scud
slowly across the sky, and a light breeze caresses you as it passes by.
The only plants within this garden seem to be the grass underfoot, and
several rose trees all over.

Desc      Soft, jagged-edged leaves brush your face gently as you walk in this
oart of the garden. The tree which grows here is one of the rose species
and quite small, reaching a height no higher than eight or so feet. Feeling
a sudden wetness, you touch your cheek, only to find your hand covered in
a thick, sticky substance not unlike blood. After a few moments, however,
you ascertain that it is actually paint. The liquid covers all the roses
upon the tree.

to be no lasting damage from your movement. The grass is neatly weeded 
and trimmed to ankle-high length, and each tree is pruned neatly into
a spherical crown. You find yourself enjoying the walk as you feel

striking shade of paint as all the other roses in this place. Moving

Dressed in red, he looks quite surprised to see you as well, but ignores

Yet, the flowers which are in full bloom have been painted in a layer
of carmine, in an apparent effort to turn them into red roses instead
of the white ones they are.

to bump into a strange person here. Though he possesses a human head, arms
and legs, his body comprises of a single piece of card, with numbers and
shapes printed upon it. The card-man appears very shocked to see you here, and

Desc      A single rose tree stands beside a tall wooden fence to the south
here. The whitewash on the fence has recently been stained by a trail
of wet scarlet liquid, and you find that it is paint which has flowed
off the petals and down the wood. The grass nearby is also liberally
splattered with paint.

Desc      Within the garden, you see that every tiny detail has been taken care
of. The grass is neatly weeded and trimmed to a length no higher than
your ankles, and the crown of each tree has been pruned into a sphere.
The only things which mar the perfection of this place are the patches 
of wet paint which drip off each tree onto the grass, and puddles of
the liquid gathered everywhere.

Desc      You wander about the rose garden, among the flourishing trees. The roses
are all in a state of severe mistreatment, having been covered in a layer
of scarlet paint. If they had been left in their pristine form, you have
no doubt that they would be blossoms of surpassing beauty. Each petal 
is as soft as velvet, and perfectly shaped. However, the red paint dripping 
off every flower makes it seem as if they are shedding tears or are suffering
grievous wounds.

Desc      At this point, you stand at the foot of a marble span which stretches out
into the air above Bywater. A bright light can be seen shining from the highest
point of the arch, far to the west, and you surmise that this must be what you
saw earlier. The bridge branches from the ledge just past a pair of crystal 
doors and although the pathway is quite wide, you see no railings or any form
of protection to catch you if you should fall. Peering out tentatively, you
are nearly overcome by vertigo. A small blue mat lies on the floor here, with
a sign beside it.

Desc      As you try to walk as lightly as possible on this delicate arch, the
scenery all around stuns you with its brilliance. From here, you can see
the glittering ribbon of Branduin leading all the way to the Graecian
Ocean. The colossal tree towers in the distance, and even at this height,
you see it soar above, further into the clouds. Southward, the graceful
spires of Palainth can be glimpsed past the murky shadows of Bloodmire
and craggy mountains rise upward from the north. To the east, you see
the arch ending in the tower chamber, whilst a bright glow emanates from
the west.

Desc      Here, you stand just eastward of the radiant altar consecrated to Meia
at the tip of the arch which seems to lead nowhere after that. As you
walk leisurely, you note the intricate carving on the marble bridge and
wonder at the identity of the artisans who built this tower. Simple
lines cut into the stone weave into a complex image of a stylised storm
and a figure superimposed somehow over the thunderclouds who seems
familiar.

Desc      The bridge ends here, jutting out far above Bywater. Upon the edge stands
a statue of Meia, dressed as she was in her youthful mortal years, blazing with
a pearlesque radiance. It is carved from the same rare stone as the rest of her
temple, but somehow imbued with an aura of raw elemental power which even you
can detect easily. The statue seems more lifelike than any you have seen
before, and at any moment, you expect her to string her bow, or speak gently
to the supplicants before her. Before the statue is a silvertable, worked in
such fine detail that you know it must be of dwarven make. A willow chalice
shaped by the craft of wild  elves stands in the centre of the table, flanked
by a fiery quill blazing in an adamantite stand and a pair of golden sandals.
It has been said that the quill was a gift from the gods themselves, as well as
the sandals, and Meia earned them through quests during her journeys.

Desc      You stand in a nondescript room, right at the top of the Tower. Hay is
scattered liberally around, and sleeping here seems like a very good
idea. There is not much in the way of furniture, with only a small table
on one side. A metal basin of water is set upon the table, and a soft
towel is beside it. Two large windows are cut into the walls opposite
to each other, and from them, you can gaze over the countryside around
Bywater for miles around. A small card sits upon the towel, and you feel
somehow drawn to examine it.

small casement area at the base. Crystal panels are fitted on every
available surface here, and each of the smooth surfaces glows softly
with a gentle bluish light. A twisted stair of mahogany leads further
downward into a dense growth of thorns, while a beautiful door cut from
a single piece of thick wood and burnished with designs of mystic runes
stands in the northern portion of the wall. A large sign is displayed
above the doorway.

the crystal panelled area. Each of the smooth mirrored surfaces glows
softly with a light of its own, casting a soft bluish light on your

growth of thorns, while another set of runed mahogany steps spirals
upward towards the top of the tower. Looking back at the doorway you
just walked through, you see a sign displayed above it.

Desc      Sweeping aside the curtain, you enter a small chamber. The ground is
covered in smooth ceramic tiles glazed with a cerulean tint. The symbol
of a quill encircled in laurel leaves is printed upon each tile in a
darker shade. To one side, you notice a glassy stepladder leading upward
to a gleaming trapdoor made of the same material as the tiles, while a
mahogany stairway spirals downward. Behind you, a sign is displayed
prominently above the curtain.

Desc      You gingerly descend the glassy stepladder. It seems so fragile at first
glance, but holds your weight well. Standing once more in the small
chamber upon the smooth ceramic tiles, you take a moment to admire the
artwork of Meia's symbol printed upon each piece upon the floor. To the
east, you see a curtain made of translucent material with glittering
blue beads sewn in the same pattern as the symbols on the tiles. It
flutters gently in a constant breeze. A sign is displayed prominently
over the curtained archway. On one side, a mahogany stairway with an
intricate design of runes spirals downward.

Desc      After trudging up the mountain, you finally reach the base of the ivory
tower you have seen from a distance. The walls of the tower give off a
radiant glow as though they are acting as mirrors reflecting all the
sunlight from the sun. The funny thing is that this happens even though
the sun is obscured by clouds. The sweet scent of roses waft down from
within the tower and an ivory staircase leads up into the garden.
