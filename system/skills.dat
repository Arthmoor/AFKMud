things are immune to acid and you get it at a lower level. This spell is
VERY destructive to mob equipment. It is the weakest of the four acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.~

a disagreement. Things quickly got out of hand, however, when two
opposing groups of magi wanted the same area of land. Not much is known of the
horrific battle that ensued other than this spell was cast by both sides,
many times, destroying everything in sight. All of the mages thought to have
known the secret to casting this spell were dead, neither side winning this
slaughter. How, you wonder, could this spell appear here?~

Helptext     This spell enables the target character to float. It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), makes a character float slowly to the ground when
falling from in the air, and allows you to move over water and through the

If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, and you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast float immediately.~

victim, a sphere of quantum probability optimized in such a way as to
cause the most bizarre contortion of bodily order imaginable. Organs
and tissues are rendered into unrecognizable blobs interconnected in
fiendish, unknowable geometries.
 
Obviously, such an attack has astonishing effects on any physical
creature, as well as any entity which has an extension into the
physical world.~

Helptext     Gnomes always seem to have a natural affinity for blowing things up or
setting them on fire. It is no wonder that they have perfected this art
in the form of crude flashpowder-based incendary devices that can be
thrown at enemies before detonating in a ball of fire and shrapnel.
Naturally the damage done is directly tied in to the Gnome's intelligence
and wisdom as it takes both to create such potent explosive weapons.~
