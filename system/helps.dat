Text SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:

  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:

  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do a 'stat r')
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:

  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"

what equipment you can wear. Trying to wear an antigood item whilst you
are of good alignment will result in you being zapped, dropping the

non-standard and will not be supported.

Areaconvert cannot load CalareyMUD zones due to format incompatibilities.

This command should also be able to load files saved with the Orb area editor, or with 
Nick Gammon's area editor program. No guarantees of course, that would be just wrong :)

This is a one-way conversion, there is no way to convert it back to it's original state 
once it's done. If you need the original unmodified file for some reason, it should still
be sitting right where you left it..... :)

If you're feeling like a gambler and have a whole mess of zones to try to convert, you can
throw caution to the wind and toss them all in your 'area' directory and reboot.            

Keep in mind that whichever method of conversion you choose to attempt, it is }R*NOT*&D
possible to renumber the vnums on the fly!!! So don't even hope for that. If you have a vnum
conflict, you'll need to temporarily stop loading the area causing it, or do the conversion
work by hand. Once you've loaded the new area, renumber it, problem solved.

Assassinate is used in an attempt to instantly kill a single victim. Only

use the stealth required to assassinate someone. A mob that is wounded or

Text Usage: assist <character>

When you type "assist <character>" you will begin fighting the same person
that character is.

ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the character continues fighting (and
being beaten upon!). It is better than KILL in many cases because you do
not have to choose between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered
the room). ASSIST will help you to eliminate one aggressor much faster,
by having more than one character fighting one single enemy. Note that
you can assist NPCs, too, should there be a need to.

To make it easier when adventuring with others, there is a CONFIG option
called AUTOASSIST that will have you automatically assist those in your
group, if they engage in battle in the same room as you.

Text Auctioning in the Lands is now handled via various auction houses that
exist in some of the major cities. For specific details on how to use
the system, read the banner posted in an auction house.
 
Items posted for auction will be retained by the auctioneer for up to
1 year of game time. This has been done to curb the problem of leaving
things behind at the shop. An item that exceeds the 1 year storage time
will be donated to the donations area in the Bywater Temple.
 
An item which has been purchased by a player will be kept by the
auctioneer for up to 1 year, from the time of the sale. Afterwards,
if the item has not been picked up, the auctioneer will donate the item
to the temple in Bywater. The seller does not collect for this, to curb the
problem of people bidding on and not collecting their goods.

If an item is sold, the seller cannot collect their money until the buyer
picks up the item!

A seller may only have 10 items offered at an auctioneer at any given time.
This is to prevent 1 person from dominating the shop with too many items.

Sold items should no longer be listed on the auctioneers item list.
 
To counter bid for items currently being sold to someone, use the command: 
Bid <amount>
 
The amount you bid naturally has to be at least 100 gold coins higher than
the current price the item is being sold at.

To pick up an item you have successfully bid and won, you must go to the auction
house and use the command: collect <item>

This code runs the authorization system. It should be set to a reasonably

A player who is authorized by the code offline will be permitted to
gain levels up to level 5 before being required to obtain authorization.
 
To approve a name, simply type 'authorize <name>' and the name will be
approved.
 
To deny a name, and remove the associated player file type:
'authorize <name> no'. This option should only be used for a name that 
is considered extremely offensive, this option will delete the pfile.
 
To have the player change names, type: 'authorize <name> change'.

If the authorize list is somehow broken, IE: a name can't be approved
or denied, type: 'authorize fixlist'.

Levels 103-106 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure there are not any
players waiting for authorization. The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if a name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it. If you are in doubts to a name's acceptability, but it is not profane or

Keywords CAST SPELL
Text Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
Syntax: c <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting. Casting
spells cost mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure critic' frag. Quoting is optional for
single-word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

To see the help for each spell, simply replace cast with help ;) Remember
to include ' around multiple-word spells for better accuracy.

Keywords CENTAUR CENTAURS
Text With the upper body of a Human and the lower body of a horse, Centaurs 
are among the most intriguing of all the races. Secretive and mysterious 
creatures with an affinity for nature and the element of wind, they roam 
the lands as adventurers or caretakers of nature. Hence, members of this 
mellow tempered race prefer to avoid cities and heavily populated 
settlements. It is not really known if there are any such things as 
Centaur settlements as none have been observed, though there are many 
rumors of a secret Centaur forest. With well muscled torsos and four 
powerful legs like that of the horse, Centaurs are extremely dextrous and 
can outrun anything travelling on land. However, since they are such a 
solitary race, their lack of contact with those of other races impacts on 
their charisma and their knowledge of the technologies in the land. As 
they are so close to nature, very rarely does one find a Centaur on the 
side of evil. Most prefer to follow the ways of neutrality. Centaurs are 
masters of archery, their skills with the bow legendary even among the
Elven kind. Thus, most Centaurs become Rangers, or they strive to be 
protectors of nature as Druids. They are also able to take up the Warrior 
or Cleric classes.

Centaurs stand anywhere between five foot four inches to six feet tall 
with long flowing hair. Their upper torsos appear in all ways to be 
Human-like while their lower bodies resemble that of horses. They have 
four powerful legs and they can use both their hind legs and fore legs 
to deliver crushing kicks to their opponents. When encountering a 
Centaur, never ever ask to ride on them as this is a grave insult.

will be faced with an illusion of one of the mobs found in the lands. You
have to kill the mob and obtain the token found on it. You must have all 9
tokens for that challenge before you can claim the prize.

There will also be question rooms found in the challenges where you have to
answer a question based on the lore of the lands. If you answer correctly,
you will be transported to the next room. If you answer incorrectly, you will

is that you are free to engage another such deadly character in combat. There

Refer to HELP RULES, #2. A deadly may not harm a non-deadly in ANY way, be
it intentional or accidental. Aside from this, deadlies are free to deal with
other deadlies as they see fit.
 
Along these lines, it is also forbidden for a non-deadly to assist a deadly
in combat with another deadly. Anyone caught doing so will be dealt with in
the same manner as a deadly who harms a non-deadly.

Keywords DEATH
Text When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the temple.
Up until you reach level 10, your corpse will be brought back to the temple
with you. After that, your corpse is left behind where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment, and your gold.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time. The longer the corpse exists, the more rotten it
becomes. Eventually it will become nothing but a skeleton. Skeletons will
last for several hours of real time before decaying into dust. Your items
and gold will remain with your corpse or skeleton. As long as this is the
case, your stuff is safe from reboots and crashes. Once the skeleton decays,
your items and gold will be laying on the ground. At this point a crash or
reboot will result in item/gold loss.

Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.

If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse. Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.

Text Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and

   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.

Keywords DROW
Text Drow, the Dark Elves, dwell in the deepest caverns below the surface 
far away from the light of the sun. Obsidian-skinned kin to the Elves, 
this fell race has won mastery over magic and a cruel reputation. Masters 
of subtle treachery and stealth, they cannot even be trusted by those of 
their own kind. They are a race wholly dedicated to the tenets of evil 
and will mercilessly slaughter those that get in their way. They especially 
hate their surface dwelling cousins. Although they are physically weaker 
than the surface Elves, the Drow more than make up for their lack of 
strength with their uncanny agility and stunning intelligence. This mental
readiness gives them a deadly intellectual edge over most creatures. They 
are whispered to be even more talented in magic than their High-Elven 
cousins. As race that has lived in darkness for centuries on end, the 
Drow learn to use shadows for expert concealment from prying eyes. Unlike 
any other known race, the Drow follow a matriarchal hierarchy. Drow 
females tend to have more power and authority in their cities than the 
males, especially the Drow priestesses. Experts at stealth and the arcane, 
the Drow tend to favour the Mage, Necromancer, and Cleric classes.
They can also become fearsome Warriors or successful Rogues. 
As with all Elvenkind, the Drow have an innate resistance to sleep and 
charm enchantments and they have the ability of infravision.

As beautiful as their Elven kin, the Drow have uniformly jet-black skin. 
They are lithe, slim and graceful in build. A majority of them have 
snow-white hair and ruby-red eyes, although some rare colors have been 
known to exist among the Drow. All Drow eyes tend to grow redder when they
are angry or upset.

Keywords DRUID DRUIDS
Text The Druid is a lover and protector of the natural land. Be it the forests 
full of birds  and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a Druid always strives to protect and preserve nature. Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work. 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged 
lifestyle, a Druid has many disciplines upon which to draw. From powerful 
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the 
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of
nature which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and 
split the sky, Druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a 
hobby, but a way of life for them. Able to face many warriors on almost
even footing, and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some Mages,
Druids are truly a gifted class. All those of the Druidic order must be 
careful to remain neutrally aligned at all times or they will permanently 
lose all their Druid powers and become Clerics. The Druid relies on wisdom 
and charisma as his prime stats. Only Humans, Centaur, High-Elves, 
Wild-Elves and Pixies can become Druids.

Text Duergar, or the Dark Dwarves, resemble their Dwarven cousins in most

hardy creatures. Unlike their friendlier cousins, the Duergar are much 
more sly and cunning, almost always preferring to use underhanded fighting
techniques such as poisoning, crippling and blinding attacks. All Dwarves 
and Duergar are blood-adversaries, and will attack each other on sight 
with a ruthlessness that is second only to the Drow. The Duergar have the 
reputation of being one of the most feared races in the land, not only
for their bloodthirsty nature but also for their expertise in assassination.
Their thick, muscular frames coupled with their short stature give them 
poor dexterity, but high stamina and strength give them the edge needed in 
their element. The prime aims of the Duergar is to conquer and expand their
holdings. As with the Dwarves, they covet precious metals and gems but 
unlike their cousins, they also seek out valuable magical treasures. 
Because of their dark dealings with the forces of evil, all dark dwarves 
have an innate resistance against draining spells. They also possess the 
inherent ability to see all that is hidden from normal view. Duergar 
adventurers make excellent Warriors. Besides this, they can also 
endeavour to become expert Rogues or Clerics.

Duergar average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with pale 
white complexions and thick, hairy torsos and limbs. Their eyes come in a 
range of colors, most usually red or purple. Unlike the Dwarves however, 
the Duergar do not put much emphasis on growing beards.

This race has produced some of the most renowned fighters. Second to their

and are masters when it comes to forging things with the use of these 
metals. Dwarves are also somewhat resistant to poison and magic. They 
dislike all magic use and magical items with the exception of enchanted

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained

as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to 
change everything inside the boundry from what your standing on, into what you 
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundry,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

remarkably friendly to those they encounter in their search for new 
knowledge. Though they do not strike anyone who encounters them for the 
first time as a race to be feared, those that make this mistake will soon 
learn why most other people stay well clear of Gnomes. The Gnomes are 
fixated with new sciences and with inventing new gadgets to make life
for everyone easier. This tinkering and inventing will more than often 
result in dire consequences for those around the Gnome when some insane 
invention goes awry and starts exploding or laying waste to the 
countryside. Even though most Gnomes mean well, they are prone to many
unfortunate accidents which have gained them a great amount of notoriety. 
Thus, most of the Gnomes are left alone in the homeland of 
Mount Nevermore. No other race wants to attack nor conquer them for the
risk in getting blown up by a stray invention. Gnomish adventurers are a 
very friendly and loyal lot. They love to travel and learn new lores with 
fellow companions although they rarely lead adventuring parties as they 
are very unpredictable. As they are not very physically strong nor hardy, 
Gnomes rely on their keen intellect and wisdom to survive. Because of 
this, they make excellent Mages and Clerics. Some Gnomish adventurers 
have also been known to become reknowned Warriors and Rogues. All Gnomes 
also have the ability to see in total darkness.
                                       
Gnomes stand about as tall as their cousin Dwarves though their bodies 
are less muscular and stocky. They have a wizened, thoughtful look on 
their faces when they are thinking but this changes often to one of glee 
and excitement when they get a new idea for an invention. Some older 
Gnomes have white beards while the younger ones prefer to remain

Keywords HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES
Text A mixing of Human and Elven blood, these attractive creatures are neither 
as intelligent as full-blood Elves, nor as hardy as full-blood Humans. 
It would seem that this race has also inherited the behavioural 
characteristics of both the Humans and the Elves. They are known to be 
as stubborn and headstrong as the Humans and as graceful the Elves. A 
common trait among Half-Elves is their warm and friendly personality 
towards all races with the exception of the evil races. This comes
mainly from the fact that they understand the disdain and discrimination 
which some of the more old fashioned High-Elves show towards them and 
hence they try their best not to follow in the narrow minded High-Elves' 
foolish ways. Half-Elven adventurers serve the best in classes which 
require a good mix of mental and physical dexterity without demanding 
superiority in either. This trait makes them excellent Bards.
They can also endeavour to become any class besides the 
Paladin, Anti-Paladin, Druid or Ranger. Also inherited from their Elven 
blood is the ability to see in the dark using infravision.

Though not as tall as the pure blooded Elf, a Half-Elf is a relatively 
tall creature ranging from five foot five inches to six foot five inches. 
The males have a generally more muscular build than pure blooded Elves 
and the females are usually more attractive than the average Humans. 
This serves them well in the adventuring lifestyle. They also sometimes 
sport partially shaved beards. As with all Elfin related races, the

the attributes of another race to form a ferocious and extremely war-like 
race. Usually standing from six to nine feet in height and packed with
rippling muscles, they possess great skill in battle, enabling this race 
to thrive in battle. Half-Ogres never settle down in communities, most 
preferring to join moving war tribes and pillage what they need from the 
other races. Some however do travel alone in the world, seeking to spread 
chaos and death. Half-Ogres tend to also be dim-witted and can be 
outsmarted by most other races. However they usually get their own back
using brute strength and crude, direct tactics. They dont shun away from 
fights except when hopelessly overpowered and often engage in battle to 
establish superiority, even within their own tribes. Perhaps the only 
thing which strikes fear into a Half-Ogres heart is the use of magic, 
simply because they do not understand it. A powerful frame coupled with 
the ability to see in the dark, the Half-Ogre is a natural born Warrior 
and can specialize only in that and the Cleric class. Most of their race 
love to wield huge weapons that can crush bones in a single blow such as 
clubs, battle axes, sledgehammers and large tridents.

Half-Ogres usually come in skin colors ranging from an orangy tinge to a 
greenish hue. The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogres are commonly covered 
in small, bony, armor-like growths which protect them from attacks. Most 
are relatively hairless, with disproportional limbs and bent, muscular
legs, giving many a stooping appearance. Some Half-Ogres wear a necklace 
made out of their victims' ears and sport gruesome tattoos to show off 
their battle prowess.

However some Half-Orcs do appear pleasing to the Human eye, depending on

of how well they blend in to civilised communities, Half-Orcs are always

lack of facial hair and sharp fang-like incisors which are sometimes as 
prominent as tusks depending on the Half-Orc in question. A misunderstood

a deep, blackish green. Half-Trolls revel in the fright of their

       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

Keywords HUMAN HUMANS
Text Humans are the most common and numerous of the races. This however makes 
them no less interesting. They possess no special abilities or bonuses, 
but also have no penalties. Because of this, Humans are the most adaptable 
of all the other races. They can assume and often excel at a variety of 
roles. Humans also live very exciting lives. Because of their relatively 
short lifespans, they tend to do as much adventuring as they can, 
accomplishing much in their lives. Humans also have a range of 
personalities and values, such that no two humans behave exactly alike. 
All in all, humans are a very exciting and lively race.

Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish 
head. Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look very different 
from each other. Differences in skin coloring, size, hair and eye color, 
speech and facial features are among the things that distinguishes one 
human from another.

Keywords IGUANADON IGUANADONS
Text Well known throughout the free Lands for their fearsome visages and 
ferocious savagery, the terrifying Iguanadons are also the most mysterious 
of all races. Though they are rumored to have been descended from the 
giant lizards of the past and that the blood of Dragons courses through
their veins, no one knows for sure the exact origins of this dangerous 
race. Even the locations of Iguanadons settlements are not commonly known. 
Secretive and often solitary, the Iguanadons travel to all parts of the 
world, working to further some dark and unknown purpose. Hence, they tend 
to avoid most major settlements for fear of being attacked by those that 
do not understand them. Sleek and well muscled, the Iguanadon is 
relatively stronger and more agile than most races though they are less 
intelligent and wise. As they are semi-aquatic creatures with the ability 
to breathe underwater for long periods of time, most Iguanadons prefer 
the dampness of humid areas such as swamps, rivers and underwater caverns.
One would almost never encounter an Iguanadon in a dry and hot climate
such as deserts. Because of their reptilian nature, all Iguanadons are 
resistant to cold based attacks. While Iguanadons make exemplary Warriors,
those of the other races speak of Iguandons Rogues with great dread for 
their skills are near matchless with the exception of the Duergar and 
the Drow. Rarely, Iguanadon Clerics can also be found wandering the Land.
                                       
The Iguanadon stands about a head taller than the average Human. 
Physically they appear to be giant manlike lizards who stand upright like 
most humanoid races. Sharp claws and a powerful tail add to their 
deadliness in combat. Their scaly, cold bodies are excellent for spending 
prolonged time in cold and wet areas. Most Iguanadons have greenish to 
grey skin and their eyes are a dull yellow color.

Keywords IMPLOCK
Text Syntax: implock

IMPLOCK is a toggle command, much like wizlock, with the exception that
it also prevents immortals below level 113 from logging in as well.
Connected players and immortals who lose their links will NOT be able to
reconnect past an implock. This would be grounds for reimbursement of
any mortal affected by this if they lose their inventory.

This command is not to be used casually, it is intended to lock the mud
down in the even of a critical problem or bug, or perhaps even a
security risk of some kind. Be prepared to explain the reason for an
implock to any other imps who ask.

If the situation is dire enough, then the head implementor may wish to
deploy a total LOCKDOWN to reduce possible damage to the game files or
to disk space on the server itself.

Implock will persist across reboots so it will not be necessary to relock
the mud in the event of crashes or reboots. A message informing other
imps will be displayed as they log in.

Keywords LINKDEAD
Text A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

 Addendum to II : you can reconnect without dropping link.  This is known as
    usurping your body.  Therefore, you never have to ask for a disconnect.
    So, if your link freezes, and you can open another telnet (or tin, or 
    whatever) session, you're in good shape.

  If you go linkdead while not in combat, you run the serious risk
of not only being assaulted by aggressive monsters, but of dying of either
hunger, or thirst, or both while you are away. You will remain where you
were for aproximately 15 minutes before the game flags you as idle. Once
you are flagged idle, monsters will stop bothering you. You are still
subject to hunger and thirst. After approximately 30 minutes, you will
be autorented out of the game.

The mapedit command is used to make changes to the overland map system.
It's a fairly involved portion of the OLC code as a whole, but is not
terribly difficult to use.

Typing 'mapedit' with no other arguments toggles your editor on or off.
When on, any movement you make will change the sector you're moving to
into whatever you have yourself set for. Think of it as "painting".

To set yourself to create a sector, simply type 'mapedit sector <type>' 
where the type is something from the sectortypes list. Also note that
while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out
the mapname, the map you are currently on will be the one saved.

For details on using the floodfill option, see 'help floodfill'.

The Minotaurs are a race famed for their unyielding bravery and sense

easily identified for it has the head of a bull and the body of a 
humanoid. Gruff and short tempered, they prefer to travel alone or only 
with others of their own kind. Minotaur adventurers have one aim in life, 
to seek out new challenges and best them. Because of their impatient and
practical natures, Minotaurs prefer to put their effort and time into 
learning survival skills rather than scholarly skills. Thus they are 
viewed as less intelligent than most other races. However when in battle, 
few come close to the sheer ferocity and determination of a Minotaur. 
Nearly all Minotaurs view magic with disdain as they see it as a 
weakling's art. To them, reliance on an outside power is cowardly 
compared to relying on one's physical skills. Thus with the exception of 
the Clerics in their race, Minotaurs do not dabble in magic. Oddly, when 
they are not fighting with each other, Minotaurs and Dwarves make good 
company as they are very alike in mind. The Minotaur is capable in the 
Warrior and Cleric classes. They also have the ability to see in the dark.

The average Minotaur stands taller than most races. Most have either a 
reddish brown or a stony-grey colored skin. A pair of long, sharp horns 
grow from atop their muscled heads which they use for goring their 
opponents. Minotaurs are relatively hairless and usually prefer to wear 
very little clothing and armor.

Their punches and kicks alone can shatter and pound the hardest of

strives to excel in. The Monk class also relies on its stealth, agility and
spiritual hardiness against most elements that seek to harm it,making
them excellent explorers and worthy additions to any adventuring parties.

will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that

the game, including old copies (even if they are not online). Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change. If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object. Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'. Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives

impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it. It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess. We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length. A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.

Text Pixies resemble small Elfin creatures with thin gossamer wings. They are 
well characterised with their tinkling laughter and their ability to fly 
about like a dragonfly. Though they are much more intelligent than the 
other races, their concentration is very rarely focused on anything for 
a period of time. When talking to a Pixie, one gets easily frustrated at 
the tendency of Pixies to drift off the subject. Most Pixies prefer to 
be with others of their race and hence very rarely form long lasting
relationships with members of the other races. Pixies are a very spiritual 
race, often spending long times in the forest and close to nature. They
enjoy dancing and singing and mischievous pranks on unsuspecting victims. 
As with the Elves, Pixies have a natural affinity for magic and nature. 
They are also resistant to the effects of magical sleep or charming. 
Because of their small size, the Pixie often chooses the calling of magic 
or thievery. Most Pixies are good or neutral aligned although those of a
darker vein will pursue forbidden arts. Pixie adventurers can also become 
Clerics and Druids.

Projectiles are wielded weapons which allow players to hit victims
without being in the same room. Projectiles have several forms, those
being bow & arrow; crossbow & bolt; sling & stone; peashooter & pebble:
tube & dart. All are used in a similar manner.
 
You must first be wielding the weapon which will perform the action
of firing the intended object. To do this, simply 'wield <weaponname>
missile'. This will place the bow, sling or other firing mechanism
in the location 'missile wielded', which you will see when you type 'eq'.
 
You must have a type of projectile in your inventory, this being an arrow,
rock, bolt, pebble or other projectile(s).
 
You must have practiced 'missile weapons' in order to wield a firing
mechanism. If you do not practice it, you will not be able to fire.
 
Lastly, provided you have a projectile in inventory, and a firing
weapon wielded in the 'missile wielded' position, you are ready to
try out your new projectile.
 
Note that firing a weapon at another player will result in a pkill
attempt, which can have severe consequences. If you and your mortal
target are not both listed under "Who Deadly", you will be confronted

will be set back to the game default.

The fprompt sets your fighting prompt. This is the prompt that is displayed
to you while you are fighting. It follows the same format as the normal

Your prompt can be any string of characters that you wish. You can also embed
special characters and tokens into the string that you set. These special
characters are linked with specific groups of tokens. These tokens will add
specific sets of information to your prompt.
 
The first special character is:  %
Tokens for % are:
  %h  - current hitpoints                %m  - current mana (0 for vamp)
  %H  - maximum hitpoints                %M  - maximum mana (0 for vamp)
  %b  - current blood (0 for non-vamp)   %v  - current movement
  %B  - maximum blood (0 for non-vamp)   %V  - maximum movement
  %g  - gold held                        %x  - current experience
  %a  - your alignment                   %X  - experience needed to next level
  %A  - invisible/hide/sneak indicator   %S  - your current combat style

Fighting prompt only: %c - condition of your enemy
  
The other special characters are:

Text A Ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times. 
Known best as a defender of nature and the animals, the Ranger is a force
to be reckoned with. A self-sufficient adventurer, the Ranger is 
adaptable and can survive in almost any locale. Skilled with weapons and 
able to utilise some of the finest armor available, a Ranger is more than
skilled enough to defeat most of his foes. However, for especially hardy 
opponents, a Ranger also can cast many useful spells to both hinder his
opponent and aid himself. From minor curative magics, to calling down 
lightning from a cloudy sky, the Ranger is the most adept class at 
surviving on its own. A Ranger typically travels light, but he does have
the mighty strength of a seasoned Warrior to carry equipment needed in 
his travels. Like the Druid (a class he closely resembles), his need
for help from outside sources is low. All Rangers must remain neutral or
good aligned or they will permanently lose their Ranger abilities and 
become a Warrior. The prime attributes of Rangers are wisdom, strength 
and dexterity. Only Humans, High-Elves, Wild-Elves, Pixies and Centaurs 
can be Ranger classed.

Color is the color of the tokens you have collected to be redeemed. If the
chamber for that color is not occupied, you will then be transported to
the chamber and be prompted from there. Further help is available during
the process simply by typing 'help' at the command prompt.
 
If you plan to colorize your item, then please refer to 'help pcolors' before
beginning the process. You'll have an easier time of things if you plan out
your item description ahead of time. Feel free to test your coloring by using
the SAY channel while in the redemption chambers.

Keywords RENUMBER
Text &YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &rcheck the
code&w if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &rlimbo.are,
newdark.are, newacad.are&w.

somewhat fragile, and their combative nature makes them hard to get

Sahuagin are bipedal humanoids, standing a little taller than the
average human.  They have bluish-green scaled skin, and sport a spined
fin down their back.  Their hands and feet are webbed and are furnished

     -1, anyone from those respective fields can devote to that deity. If RACE
     is set to -1, none of the other races matter. The same thing goes for

*5 - If you set one, you need to set the counterpart (i.e. SUSCEPTNUM and

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.

Call: Summons a skyship down to the landing site to await passengers.

Text Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons

Whips are weapons that are quite unique in that they are usually more 
lightweight than other weapons. They also don't have to rely on brute force
to cause damage, rather they need just the right flick of the wrist to
hurt.

Keywords WILD-ELF WILD-ELVES
Text As their name implies, the Wild-Elves truly are a wild race. Fun-loving 
thrill seekers, the Wild-Elves are an enigma to their High-Elven cousins. 
Unlike the patient and contemplative High-Elves, the Wild-Elves are an 
emotional and adventurous people. Though basically part of the same 
species, the Wild-Elves are much more muscular and hardier than their 
cousins but they are not as intelligent. They can truly combine inherent 
Elven grace with the fighting fury of a jungle cat, making them awesome 
in battle. Their free and unpredictable ways make enemies of this breed 
of Elvenkind fear to fight them even when they are in their own element. 
Above all else, Wild-Elves hate Necromancers as they see them as defilers
of all that is natural.. Regardless of their ferocity in battle, the 
Wild-Elves are still well known to be a hospitable and friendly race to 
all goodly races, even to the Half-Elves. This is because they understand 
and connect well with all outcasts as the High-Elves treat Wild-Elves with 
the same respect as the Half-Elves. The Wild-Elves have an interesting 
view that all races were created equal, to be children of the land. And no 
race should view itself as superior over another. Even though the 
Wild-Elven race tend to love staying in the forests, many adventuring 
members of their race freely roam all over the land, some even enjoying the 
sociality of cities. Wild-Elves however, connect less to the arcane 
heritage of their race and more to their ties with nature as opposed to 
their High-Elven cousins. Thus, they only practise nature magic or healing 
magic rather than wizardly magic. The Wild-Elf usually becomes a Ranger,
a Druid, or a Warrior, as that is what their race is famed for. 
They can also specialize in the Cleric, Rogue or Bard classes. Wild-Elves 
also have an innate resistance to all forms of magic and the effect of 
magically induced charming. As with all Elvenkind, they also have the 
ability to see in the dark using infravision.

The average Wild-Elf stands about as tall as the High-Elf , being well 
over six feet tall. Most have tanned skin and long, straight hair. They 
are uncannily graceful and have beautiful features. The most distinctive 
feature about Wild-Elves is their pointed ears and their intricate arm 
tattoos.

'Wimpy <value>' allows you to set your wimpy at a level you determine,
but it cannot exceed about 75% of your maximum hitpoints.
 
'Wimpy max' sets your wimpy at its maximum level for you.
 
Some monsters are wimpy.

Text Wisdom (WIS in your 'score') represents your character's wisdom and ability
to incorporate learning.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the number of practices a character gains each time it levels
 
 - the mana a character gains each time it levels, though intelligence
   affects this much more heavily
 
 - the percentage a character learns of a new language at each practice,
   though intelligence affects this slightly more
 
 - the ability to remove a trap or poison a weapon
 
Wisdom is the prime attribute of druids and clerics.

Keywords WIZLOCK
Text Syntax: wizlock

Wizlock is a toggle command. When the server is wizlocked, players
below level 101 may not log in. If a connected player loses their link,
they will NOT be able to reconnect past a wizlock. This would be one of
the few cases a reimbursement could be granted to any such player in the
event they lose their inventory.

This command is not to be used casually, it is intended to lock the mud
down in the event of a serious problem or bug. The implementors will want
to know why the game is wizlocked, so be prepared to explain.

If the problem is particularly serious, then an IMPLOCK may be necessary.

Wizlock now persists across reboots so that relocking the mud is no longer
necessary. A message informing other immortals of the wizlock will be
displayed as they log in.

Keywords GITH
Text The Gith are an ancient race descended from Humans. Once, long ago, they 
were a peaceful civilization of Humans that were captured by Mindflayers 
and tormented for centuries. They were used by the Mindflayers as 
unwilling mind-controlled slaves. Many were killed as the ruthless 
Mindflayers used them for warring with the other races as the Mindflayers 
themselves were physically weak and only relied on their tremendous 
mental powers to overcome obstacles. Eventually, a saviour named Gith 
led them to freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers 
of their Illithid masters. The Gith found themselves stronger, quicker, 
luckier and smarter than the average Humans, yet they had lost much of 
their faith, wisdom, stamina and charisma. They also discovered that 
they had the natural ability to resist all forms of magically induced 
charming and sleep and they could also detect all types invisible 
enchantments. Perhaps because of their long-term contact with the mental 
powers of the Illithids, the Gith have acquired some powers of the mind. 
Because of this, most Gith specialize in the arts of the Mage.
They can also become Warriors, Necromancers, Clerics, or Rogues.

The Gith have yellowed skin and are very long of limb. Sunken eyes peer 
from pale sockets, unblinking and rarely betraying a hint of emotion. 
The Gith race has split into three distinct groups recently. The good, 
the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates of Gith and the evil, 
the Githyanki.

Keywords insectoid
Text The Insectoid race lives in the arid wastelands of the Sarnen Isles to 
the west of the Alatian continent. They live primarily in nomadic tribes
subsisting from hunting and some farming, but a number of Insectoids
have been transplanted from the Sarnen Isles to Alatia, where they serve as
elite units in the army of the kingdom and as monks in some of the
monastaries. Insectoids can be Clerics, Warriors, Rangers, Druids, or
Monks.

Insectoids generally stand anywhere from 5 feet to over 7 in height, and
are covered in a chitinous exoskeleton that provides them some protection
from attacks. They range from a dull red to a light brown color. Insectoids
tend to be nimble and wise, but somewhat less intelligent and lucky than
normal. Due to their strange nature, most races tend to look on them a bit
oddly. Due to the often hostile nature of the Sarnen Isles, Insectoids are
somewhat more resistant to fire, but this is offset by their susceptibility
to cold.

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.

We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

Note from Samson: Since we have a disk quota in place, the above is
EXTREMELY CRITICAL!!! Don't let watch files get too big!
