Text     SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:

  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:

  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do a 'stat r')
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:

  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"

listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will glow red.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.

Usage: unalias <shortcut>
 
The ALIAS command allows you to set shortcuts for commands or long
strings of text. These can be quite useful for shortening routinely
entered commands. Example: alias heal cast heal samson
This assigns the command 'cast heal samson' to the alias 'heal'
so that typing in 'heal' will issue the full command.

Typing ALIAS with no arguments will list your current aliases.
Your aliases will save with your character upon leaving the game.
An alias may only contain a shortcut for a single command. If more
sophisticated aliases are needed, a mud client package would probably
serve the purpose better.
 
To remove an alias, type 'unalias' followed by the shortcut you

Text     Alignment ranges from +1000 to -1000. When your alignment is at +1000
you are of good alignment, at -1000 you are of evil alignment, and at 0
you are neutral. By killing evil mobs, you will raise your alignment
towards good. Conversely, killing good aligned creatures will lower
your alignment, bringing it towards evil.
 
Alignment plays a large part in how much you are favored by the DEITY
that you DEVOTE to, but it plays an even larger role in determining
what equipment you can wear. Trying to wear an antigood item whilst you
are of good alignment will result in you being zapped, dropping the
item to the ground. The same applies to evil characters wearing
antievil, and neutral characters wearing antineutral items. Care must
be taken during battle, as your alignment can change if you are
fighting a mob of opposing alignment, you may be zapped and drop items
in the midst of battle.

You can find out your current alignment by typing SCORE, Or if you
would like to keep a closer eye on your alignment, you can add it to

usually seen as loners, the Anti-Paladin makes an invaluable member of 
any adventuring party. As with the Paladin class, they can also utilise 
almost all forms of weapons and armor due to their fighter classed nature.
They must also remain evilly aligned at all times or they will lose their

If successful, the new area will be saved in your 'area' directory in the new format and will
be added to the area.lst file automatically.

If it's not successful, you will either have tons of log spam and a message saying it failed, 
or you won't even be here reading this silly helpfile because the mud will have crashed.

This functionality allows you to load Smaug 1.02a, 1.4a, SmaugWiz, ResortMUD,
Chronicles, Dark Rifts, DOTDII, and SWR areas. Other formats are considered
non-standard and will not be supported.

Areaconvert cannot load CalareyMUD zones due to format incompatibilities.

This command should also be able to load files saved with the Orb area editor, or with 
Nick Gammon's area editor program. No guarantees of course, that would be just wrong :)

This is a one-way conversion, there is no way to convert it back to it's original state 
once it's done. If you need the original unmodified file for some reason, it should still
be sitting right where you left it..... :)

If you're feeling like a gambler and have a whole mess of zones to try to convert, you can
throw caution to the wind and toss them all in your 'area' directory and reboot.            

Keep in mind that whichever method of conversion you choose to attempt, it is }R*NOT*&D
possible to renumber the vnums on the fly!!! So don't even hope for that. If you have a vnum
conflict, you'll need to temporarily stop loading the area causing it, or do the conversion
work by hand. Once you've loaded the new area, renumber it, problem solved.¢

Text     The arena area in the city of Graecia allows players to fight each other
without fear of losing anything. Those that are killed there will reappear
at the healer's and will not have lost any equipment, gold or experience
points. Fights need not necessarily be one-on-one and can be group fights
too. To fight properly in the arena, you will have to type 'config -nice'
before attacking or you will not be able to hit anything. Just remember
to type 'config +nice' to turn it back on after the fight. The arena is
a place for fun fighting and should be looked as a challenge between
player characters. Never attack anyone in there who isn't willing to be

Keywords ARMOR CLASS
Related    
Text     Armor Class, or AC, is based on the AD&&D system whereby the lower one's
AC is, the less often one gets hit. Armor Class ranges from "barely
armored", an AC value of 100, to "armored like a tank", an AC value of
-100.  If you are acquainted with AD&&D, a 100 corresponds to a 10 AC,
and a -100 corresponds to a -10 AC. Dexterity also affects how often
you get hit, the higher your dexterity (max of 20) the lower your natural
AC (your AC without any armor or spells on). For every point of dexterity
above 13 (14+) your natural (100) AC is reduced by 10. Natural AC varies
from race to race and 100 is standard for the human race. This does not
apply to monks.¢

things behind at the shop. An item that exceeds the 1 year storage time
will be donated to the donations area in the Bywater Temple.
 
An item which has been purchased by a player will be kept by the
auctioneer for up to 1 year, from the time of the sale. Afterwards,
if the item has not been picked up, the auctioneer will donate the item
to the temple in Bywater. The seller does not collect for this, to curb the
problem of people bidding on and not collecting their goods.

If an item is sold, the seller cannot collect their money until the buyer
picks up the item!

A seller may only have 10 items offered at an auctioneer at any given time.
This is to prevent 1 person from dominating the shop with too many items.

Sold items should no longer be listed on the auctioneers item list.
 
To counter bid for items currently being sold to someone, use the command:

The amount you bid naturally has to be at least 100 gold coins higher than

the singing of a song or the telling of a lost tale. Truly no other
class can entertain a king's court or a busy inn with such unparalleled 
skill. The Bard relies on wisdom, charisma and dexterity as his prime
stats. Only Humans, High-Elves, Wild-Elves, Half-Elves and Halflings can 
enter the Bardic class.

Keywords BITVECTOR
Related  OLC
Text     A bitvector field is a type of integer value (a normal number) that is capable
of being used to store multiple flag values in a single field. This helps
to conserve space in the data files and makes setting certain things up much
easier than without them.

Bitvectors can sometimes be a confusing topic to understand, but they are
essentially nothing more than a "doubling" value,
or a "power of 2 progression".

A bitvector may not be negative, and may not exceed 2147483647. Bitvectors are
often referred to by the shorthand "BVxx" where xx is the power of 2.

The progression of valid values looks like this:

BV00 = 0
BV01 = 1
BV02 = 2
BV03 = 4
BV04 = 8
BV05 = 16
BV06 = 32
BV07 = 64
BV08 = 128
BV09 = 256
BV10 = 512
BV11 = 1024
BV12 = 2048
BV13 = 4096
BV14 = 8192
BV15 = 16384
BV16 = 32768
BV17 = 65536
BV18 = 131072
BV19 = 262144
BV20 = 524288
BV21 = 1048576
BV22 = 2097152
BV23 = 4194304
BV24 = 8388608
BV25 = 16777216
BV26 = 33554432
BV27 = 67108864
BV28 = 134217728
BV29 = 268435456
BV30 = 536870912
BV31 = 1073741824

One bitvector value can be added to another, thus allowing multiple flags to
be set. For example, combining BV10 with BV05, BV03, and BV01 would yield 533.

Subtracting 1 from one of the specified BVxx values sets every flag below that
value on.

If for some reason a flag field on a game structure needs more than 32 flags,
then the value on that structure will need to be recoded to use the C++
std::bitset system instead.

For AFKMud, all of the structures which use std::bitset are edited online
using the names of the flags in the OLC so you do not need to worry about how
they are handled internally.¢

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting. Casting
spells cost mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure critic' frag. Quoting is optional for
single-word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

To see the help for each spell, simply replace cast with help ;) Remember
to include ' around multiple-word spells for better accuracy.

Keywords CENTAUR CENTAURS
Text     With the upper body of a Human and the lower body of a horse, Centaurs 
are among the most intriguing of all the races. Secretive and mysterious 
creatures with an affinity for nature and the element of wind, they roam 
the lands as adventurers or caretakers of nature. Hence, members of this 
mellow tempered race prefer to avoid cities and heavily populated 
settlements. It is not really known if there are any such things as 
Centaur settlements as none have been observed, though there are many 
rumors of a secret Centaur forest. With well muscled torsos and four 
powerful legs like that of the horse, Centaurs are extremely dextrous and 
can outrun anything travelling on land. However, since they are such a 
solitary race, their lack of contact with those of other races impacts on 
their charisma and their knowledge of the technologies in the land. As 
they are so close to nature, very rarely does one find a Centaur on the 
side of evil. Most prefer to follow the ways of neutrality. Centaurs are 
masters of archery, their skills with the bow legendary even among the
Elven kind. Thus, most Centaurs become Rangers, or they strive to be 
protectors of nature as Druids. They are also able to take up the Warrior 
or Cleric classes.

Centaurs stand anywhere between five foot four inches to six feet tall 
with long flowing hair. Their upper torsos appear in all ways to be 
Human-like while their lower bodies resemble that of horses. They have 
four powerful legs and they can use both their hind legs and fore legs 
to deliver crushing kicks to their opponents. When encountering a 
Centaur, never ever ask to ride on them as this is a grave insult.

will be faced with an illusion of one of the mobs found in the lands. You
have to kill the mob and obtain the token found on it. You must have all 9
tokens for that challenge before you can claim the prize.

There will also be question rooms found in the challenges where you have to
answer a question based on the lore of the lands. If you answer correctly,
you will be transported to the next room. If you answer incorrectly, you will
either be teleported to the Green Dragon Inn or death will meet you. So be

Text     With the new implementation of Weather. Comes a new meaning for Climates.
Climates are no longer what each area has, but now are a flag applied to
the weather cells across the weather "map". The following are available:
 
rainforest, savanna, desert, steppe, chapparal, grasslands, deciduous_forest, 
taiga, tundra, alpine, and arctic.
 
Now, a brief explanation will follow for each, but these flags cause the
system to force changes into cells with each update, to keep weather consistant
with what is supposed to be within that cell.
 
Rain Forest - This climate will produce a lot of rain and high heats, not quite
as hot as a desert, but hot none the less. An earth example would be the Amazon
region in South America.
 
Savanna - This is a climate that produces a two season year, one being wet, the
other being dry. And the temperature varies between but maintaining equatorial
area temperatures for earth. An example would be the Serengeti of Africa. 
Desert - Hot, Dry, Arid. This climate is home to cacti, camels, and other such
Desert creatures and plants. A prime example is the Sahara Desert.
 
Steppe - Characterized by grasslands, this is a semiarid climate. It can be
found normally between the desert climate and more humid climates. An example
of this climate would be the Mongolian Steppes in Eurasia.
 
Chapparal - This is another semiarid climate, with long dry summers and shorter
wet winters. The primary example of this is the Mediterranean Coast, or a bit
of Southern California.¢

Keywords CLIMATE2
Related  CLIMATE, SETWEATHER, SHOWWEATHER, WEATHER
Text     Grasslands - These are large climates of grassy plains and varying weather. The
rainfall in these climates is enough to support the growth of grass, but not
much else. An example would be the Great Plains of the Central United States.

Deciduous Forest - This is a "perfect" climate. This is one of the few climates
that really experiences all four seasons, with changes in each. It is normally
characterized by the lush forests that grow within it, and the varied plant
and wildlife that live within. The Eastern United States all falls under this
climate.

Taiga - The Taiga is also know as the Boreal Forest Climate, because it is
mostly only needleleafed trees that grow within this ravaging climate. The
wind in this type of climate is very unforgiving, and trees are known to 
only grow in clumps because of this. The best example of this climate
would be the interior of Alaska, or North-Central Canada.

Tundra - The tundra climate is found along arctic coastal areas. The winter
season is long and severe, and a short, mild summer exists but it barely
noticeable. The best example of the tundra would be Coastal Alaska, or
Iceland.

Alpine - These are the mountain climates found mostly (on Earth) in Eurasia.
The Himalayan Mountains are the best example. These climates produce colder
temperatures than the climates around them, merely because of altitude
difference.
 
Arctic - Cold. Always Frozen. Almost the exact opposite of a desert. Could
technically be considered a desert by the definition of the word. These
climates produce below freezing temperatures almost year round. Antarctica
would be the best example of an Arctic climate.¢

It doesn't know the difference between bad zones and good ones.

    &R-&z Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &Rand&z
    &R-&z Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles, and
    &R-&z &GImmortal corpse retrievals are NO LONGER being granted.
      The items in your corpse will not disappear after it rots.&z

If nobody answers your request to retrieve the corpse, then PLEASE,
don't keep pestering them about it. Maybe they aren't in a position
to give aid. Continued pestering for retrieval will be considered
spamming. Keep the following in mind as well:
 
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Lands comes back online. Log back on quickly to get corpse.
 
In the event of a crash that somehow manages to lose the items in the
corpse, you may then request a reimbursement of the items. This does
not mean you will get it, especially if it is found that the corpse had
rotted before the crash. Items left on the open ground will NOT be
reimbursed.¢

Text     When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the temple.
Up until you reach level 10, your corpse will be brought back to the temple
with you. After that, your corpse is left behind where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment, and your gold.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time. The longer the corpse exists, the more rotten it
becomes. Eventually it will become nothing but a skeleton. Skeletons will
last for several hours of real time before decaying into dust. Your items
and gold will remain with your corpse or skeleton. As long as this is the
case, your stuff is safe from reboots and crashes. Once the skeleton decays,
your items and gold will be laying on the ground. At this point a crash or
reboot will result in item/gold loss.

Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.

If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse. Also see 'help supplicate',

 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural

 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many

Text     Drow, the Dark Elves, dwell in the deepest caverns below the surface 
far away from the light of the sun. Obsidian-skinned kin to the Elves, 
this fell race has won mastery over magic and a cruel reputation. Masters 
of subtle treachery and stealth, they cannot even be trusted by those of 
their own kind. They are a race wholly dedicated to the tenets of evil 
and will mercilessly slaughter those that get in their way. They especially 
hate their surface dwelling cousins. Although they are physically weaker 
than the surface Elves, the Drow more than make up for their lack of 
strength with their uncanny agility and stunning intelligence. This mental
readiness gives them a deadly intellectual edge over most creatures. They 
are whispered to be even more talented in magic than their High-Elven 
cousins. As race that has lived in darkness for centuries on end, the 
Drow learn to use shadows for expert concealment from prying eyes. Unlike 
any other known race, the Drow follow a matriarchal hierarchy. Drow 
females tend to have more power and authority in their cities than the 
males, especially the Drow priestesses. Experts at stealth and the arcane, 
the Drow tend to favour the Mage, Necromancer, and Cleric classes.
They can also become fearsome Warriors or successful Rogues. 
As with all Elvenkind, the Drow have an innate resistance to sleep and 
charm enchantments and they have the ability of infravision.

As beautiful as their Elven kin, the Drow have uniformly jet-black skin. 
They are lithe, slim and graceful in build. A majority of them have 
snow-white hair and ruby-red eyes, although some rare colors have been 
known to exist among the Drow. All Drow eyes tend to grow redder when they
are angry or upset.

Text     The Druid is a lover and protector of the natural land. Be it the forests

swamps, a Druid always strives to protect and preserve nature. Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work. 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged 
lifestyle, a Druid has many disciplines upon which to draw. From powerful 
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the 
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of
nature which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and 
split the sky, Druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a 
hobby, but a way of life for them. Able to face many warriors on almost
even footing, and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some Mages,
Druids are truly a gifted class. All those of the Druidic order must be 
careful to remain neutrally aligned at all times or they will permanently 
lose all their Druid powers and become Clerics. The Druid relies on wisdom 
and charisma as his prime stats. Only Humans, Centaur, High-Elves, 
Wild-Elves and Pixies can become Druids.

aspects. As with the Dwarves, the Duergar are short, stocky and extremely 
hardy creatures. Unlike their friendlier cousins, the Duergar are much 
more sly and cunning, almost always preferring to use underhanded fighting
techniques such as poisoning, crippling and blinding attacks. All Dwarves 
and Duergar are blood-adversaries, and will attack each other on sight 
with a ruthlessness that is second only to the Drow. The Duergar have the 
reputation of being one of the most feared races in the land, not only
for their bloodthirsty nature but also for their expertise in assassination.
Their thick, muscular frames coupled with their short stature give them 
poor dexterity, but high stamina and strength give them the edge needed in 
their element. The prime aims of the Duergar is to conquer and expand their
holdings. As with the Dwarves, they covet precious metals and gems but 
unlike their cousins, they also seek out valuable magical treasures. 
Because of their dark dealings with the forces of evil, all dark dwarves 
have an innate resistance against draining spells. They also possess the 
inherent ability to see all that is hidden from normal view. Duergar 
adventurers make excellent Warriors. Besides this, they can also 
endeavour to become expert Rogues or Clerics.

Duergar average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with pale 
white complexions and thick, hairy torsos and limbs. Their eyes come in a 
range of colors, most usually red or purple. Unlike the Dwarves however, 
the Duergar do not put much emphasis on growing beards.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:

redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.

keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained
section of the map into another kind of terrain. It operates much the same way
as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to 
change everything inside the boundary from what your standing on, into what you 
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundary,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

Text     The Gith are an ancient race descended from Humans. Once, long ago, they 
were a peaceful civilization of Humans that were captured by Mindflayers 
and tormented for centuries. They were used by the Mindflayers as 
unwilling mind-controlled slaves. Many were killed as the ruthless 
Mindflayers used them for warring with the other races as the Mindflayers 
themselves were physically weak and only relied on their tremendous 
mental powers to overcome obstacles. Eventually, a savior named Gith 
led them to freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers 
of their Illithid masters. The Gith found themselves stronger, quicker, 
luckier and smarter than the average Humans, yet they had lost much of 
their faith, wisdom, stamina and charisma. They also discovered that 
they had the natural ability to resist all forms of magically induced 
charming and sleep and they could also detect all types invisible 
enchantments. Perhaps because of their long-term contact with the mental 
powers of the Illithids, the Gith have acquired some powers of the mind. 
Because of this, most Gith specialize in the arts of the Mage.
They can also become Warriors, Necromancers, Clerics, or Rogues.

The Gith have yellowed skin and are very long of limb. Sunken eyes peer 
from pale sockets, unblinking and rarely betraying a hint of emotion. 
The Gith race has split into three distinct groups recently. The good,

Text     The Gnomish race are without a doubt the among the most curious and 
peculiar folk in the world. Quirky and easily excitable, they are also 
remarkably friendly to those they encounter in their search for new 
knowledge. Though they do not strike anyone who encounters them for the 
first time as a race to be feared, those that make this mistake will soon 
learn why most other people stay well clear of Gnomes. The Gnomes are 
fixated with new sciences and with inventing new gadgets to make life
for everyone easier. This tinkering and inventing will more than often 
result in dire consequences for those around the Gnome when some insane 
invention goes awry and starts exploding or laying waste to the 
countryside. Even though most Gnomes mean well, they are prone to many
unfortunate accidents which have gained them a great amount of notoriety. 
Thus, most of the Gnomes are left alone in the homeland of 
Mount Nevermore. No other race wants to attack nor conquer them for the
risk in getting blown up by a stray invention. Gnomish adventurers are a 
very friendly and loyal lot. They love to travel and learn new lore with 
fellow companions although they rarely lead adventuring parties as they 
are very unpredictable. As they are not very physically strong nor hardy, 
Gnomes rely on their keen intellect and wisdom to survive. Because of 
this, they make excellent Mages and Clerics. Some Gnomish adventurers 
have also been known to become renowned Warriors and Rogues. All Gnomes 
also have the ability to see in total darkness.
                                       
Gnomes stand about as tall as their cousin Dwarves though their bodies 
are less muscular and stocky. They have a wizened, thoughtful look on 
their faces when they are thinking but this changes often to one of glee 
and excitement when they get a new idea for an invention. Some older 
Gnomes have white beards while the younger ones prefer to remain 
beardless.¢

It would seem that this race has also inherited the behavioral 
characteristics of both the Humans and the Elves. They are known to be 
as stubborn and headstrong as the Humans and as graceful the Elves. A 
common trait among Half-Elves is their warm and friendly personality 
towards all races with the exception of the evil races. This comes
mainly from the fact that they understand the disdain and discrimination 
which some of the more old fashioned High-Elves show towards them and 
hence they try their best not to follow in the narrow minded High-Elves' 
foolish ways. Half-Elven adventurers serve the best in classes which 
require a good mix of mental and physical dexterity without demanding 
superiority in either. This trait makes them excellent Bards.
They can also endeavor to become any class besides the 
Paladin, Anti-Paladin, Druid or Ranger. Also inherited from their Elven 
blood is the ability to see in the dark using infravision.

Though not as tall as the pure blooded Elf, a Half-Elf is a relatively 
tall creature ranging from five foot five inches to six foot five inches. 
The males have a generally more muscular build than pure blooded Elves 
and the females are usually more attractive than the average Humans.

the attributes of another race to form a ferocious and extremely war-like 
race. Usually standing from six to nine feet in height and packed with
rippling muscles, they possess great skill in battle, enabling this race 
to thrive in battle. Half-Ogres never settle down in communities, most 
preferring to join moving war tribes and pillage what they need from the 
other races. Some however do travel alone in the world, seeking to spread 
chaos and death. Half-Ogres tend to also be dim-witted and can be 
outsmarted by most other races. However they usually get their own back
using brute strength and crude, direct tactics. They don't shy away from 
fights except when hopelessly overpowered and often engage in battle to 
establish superiority, even within their own tribes. Perhaps the only 
thing which strikes fear into a Half-Ogres heart is the use of magic, 
simply because they do not understand it. A powerful frame coupled with 
the ability to see in the dark, the Half-Ogre is a natural born Warrior 
and can specialize only in that and the Cleric class. Most of their race 
love to wield huge weapons that can crush bones in a single blow such as 
clubs, battle axes, sledgehammers and large tridents.

Half-Ogres usually come in skin colors ranging from an orangy tinge to a 
greenish hue. The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogres are commonly covered 
in small, bony, armor-like growths which protect them from attacks. Most 
are relatively hairless, with disproportional limbs and bent, muscular
legs, giving many a stooping appearance. Some Half-Ogres wear a necklace 
made out of their victims' ears and sport gruesome tattoos to show off 
their battle prowess.¢

have the nature to follow the tenets of evil, often gathering with their 
own kind and launching barbaric raids against the other races in the 
land. Even the Orcish and Ogre kind are not safe from Half-Trolls though 
they sometimes form alliances to plunder goodly races' settlements. As
expected, all Half-Trolls are excellent Warriors and Clerics.

Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins, 
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-Troll ranges from a charcoal grey to 
a deep, blackish green. Half-Trolls revel in the fright of their 
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning 
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect. They also 
enjoy making sport of their victims, often toying with helpless enemies 
before torturing them to death and then eating their raw flesh.¢

Related    
Text     Short, chubby and very mischievous, the Halfling is among the most 
fun-loving races in the land. The Halflings are known notoriously for 
their light-fingered thieving abilities and their hearty appetites. No 
Halfling has ever turned down a meal. A joyful and happy race, they 
almost always work for the side of goodness or neutrality. Very rarely 
does one encounter an evil Halfling, but one or two rogues have been 
known to exist. Halfling adventurers tend not to dabble in the magical 
arts of spellcasting although they do covet magically enchanted 
trinkets. Because of this, they prefer to spend their lives exploring 
and visiting new places rather than studying tomes of magic. All of the
Halflings found in the world come from the City of Bywater where they 
live until the lust for adventure overtakes them. Few Halflings decide 
to stay in the city without going on an adventure or two. Many Halflings 
choose the path of the Rogue, for which their stealthy footstep and 
nimble fingers serve them well. This dexterity coupled with a surprising 
fearlessness makes them a ferocious opponent. Halflings can also choose 
to pursue the life of a Warrior, a Cleric, or a Bard.¢

High Elves are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence

regal and aloof from the other races as they perceive themselves to be 
the first mortal beings in the world. A contemplative and patient race, 
the High Elves are amongst the longest lived races in the land with lives 
spanning centuries. Almost all High Elves dabble in magic, some even do
it unknowingly. Those that dedicate their lives to the pursuit of magical 
arts live to become very powerful magic users. Most High Elves work on
the side of goodness, traveling throughout the land to right the wrongs 
and to vanquish evil creatures. However, there are those High Elves that 
have been seduced by darker arts and are seen as outcasts to the Elven 
race. Because of their affinity, the Elves have the inherent ability to 
resist magical sleep or charming. They also have the ability to see in 
the dark. High Elven adventurers have the capability to become any class 
except Necromancers, Paladins and Anti-Paladins, though they 
function best in their element and many prefer to be Mages, Druids 
or Rangers.

The average High Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six 
feet tall. most have fair skin and long, straight hair. They are

Keywords IGUANADON IGUANADONS
Related    
Text     Well known throughout the free Lands for their fearsome visages and 
ferocious savagery, the terrifying Iguanadons are also the most mysterious 
of all races. Though they are rumored to have been descended from the 
giant lizards of the past and that the blood of Dragons courses through
their veins, no one knows for sure the exact origins of this dangerous 
race. Even the locations of Iguanadons settlements are not commonly known. 
Secretive and often solitary, the Iguanadons travel to all parts of the 
world, working to further some dark and unknown purpose. Hence, they tend 
to avoid most major settlements for fear of being attacked by those that 
do not understand them. Sleek and well muscled, the Iguanadon is 
relatively stronger and more agile than most races though they are less 
intelligent and wise. As they are semi-aquatic creatures with the ability 
to breathe underwater for long periods of time, most Iguanadons prefer 
the dampness of humid areas such as swamps, rivers and underwater caverns.
One would almost never encounter an Iguanadon in a dry and hot climate
such as deserts. Because of their reptilian nature, all Iguanadons are 
resistant to cold based attacks. While Iguanadons make exemplary Warriors,
those of the other races speak of Iguandons Rogues with great dread for 
their skills are near matchless with the exception of the Duergar and 
the Drow. Rarely, Iguanadon Clerics can also be found wandering the Land.
                                       
The Iguanadon stands about a head taller than the average Human. 
Physically they appear to be giant manlike lizards who stand upright like 
most humanoid races. Sharp claws and a powerful tail add to their 
deadliness in combat. Their scaly, cold bodies are excellent for spending 
prolonged time in cold and wet areas. Most Iguanadons have greenish to 
grey skin and their eyes are a dull yellow color.¢

implock to any other imps who ask.

If the situation is dire enough, then the head implementor may wish to

to disk space on the server itself.

Implock will persist across reboots so it will not be necessary to relock

Keywords LINKDEAD
Related  AUTORENT
Text     A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

 Addendum to II : you can reconnect without dropping link.  This is known as
    usurping your body.  Therefore, you never have to ask for a disconnect.
    So, if your link freezes, and you can open another telnet (or tin, or 
    whatever) session, you're in good shape.

  If you go linkdead while not in combat, you run the serious risk
of not only being assaulted by aggressive monsters, but of dying of either
hunger, or thirst, or both while you are away. You will remain where you
were for approximately 15 minutes before the game flags you as idle. Once
you are flagged idle, monsters will stop bothering you. You are still
subject to hunger and thirst. After approximately 30 minutes, you will
be autorented out of the game.¢

The mapedit command is used to make changes to the overland map system.
It's a fairly involved portion of the OLC code as a whole, but is not
terribly difficult to use.

Typing 'mapedit' with no other arguments toggles your editor on or off.
When on, any movement you make will change the sector you're moving to
into whatever you have yourself set for. Think of it as "painting".

To set yourself to create a sector, simply type 'mapedit sector <type>' 
where the type is something from the sectortypes list. Also note that
while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out
the mapname, the map you are currently on will be the one saved.

For details on using the floodfill option, see 'help floodfill'.

The Minotaurs are a race famed for their unyielding bravery and sense 
of honor. Standing usually over six feet in height, the Minotaur is 
easily identified for it has the head of a bull and the body of a 
humanoid. Gruff and short tempered, they prefer to travel alone or only 
with others of their own kind. Minotaur adventurers have one aim in life, 
to seek out new challenges and best them. Because of their impatient and
practical natures, Minotaurs prefer to put their effort and time into 
learning survival skills rather than scholarly skills. Thus they are 
viewed as less intelligent than most other races. However when in battle, 
few come close to the sheer ferocity and determination of a Minotaur. 
Nearly all Minotaurs view magic with disdain as they see it as a 
weakling's art. To them, reliance on an outside power is cowardly 
compared to relying on one's physical skills. Thus with the exception of 
the Clerics in their race, Minotaurs do not dabble in magic. Oddly, when 
they are not fighting with each other, Minotaurs and Dwarves make good 
company as they are very alike in mind. The Minotaur is capable in the 
Warrior and Cleric classes. They also have the ability to see in the dark.

The average Minotaur stands taller than most races. Most have either a 
reddish brown or a stony-grey colored skin. A pair of long, sharp horns 
grow from atop their muscled heads which they use for goring their 
opponents. Minotaurs are relatively hairless and usually prefer to wear 
very little clothing and armor.¢

Text     A master of ancient hand-to-hand combat,the Monk stands without par.
No other class has the ability to control and tone its physical form into
such a deadly combination of spirit and fighting prowess.Because they
have such mastery, Monks rarely need any weapons at all when adventuring.
Their punches and kicks alone can shatter and pound the hardest of
substances. However, combat is not everything this breed of adventurer
strives to excel in. The Monk class also relies on its stealth, agility and
spiritual hardiness against most elements that seek to harm it,making
them excellent explorers and worthy additions to any adventuring parties.
For this, the Monk class relies on no one attribute but rather a well
balanced set of attributes. However because of the rigorous discipline
and concentration required to become a Monk, only Humans and Insectoids
can become adept in this class.¢

say You're new around here, aren't you, $n?

that particular bit yet), use != instead.¢

 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,

 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Joe as 'Eoj'.
 
&zPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on. In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online). Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change. If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object. Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'. Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives

Warriors are the scourge of all that is evil. Paladins are able to wear
most forms of armor and use all types of basic weapons though he does 
not like to hoard wealth and items. Naturally, Paladins must remain true
to the side of goodness and hence must retain a good alignment throughout
their lives. Should they fail their calling and deviate from good, they 
will be stripped of their powers and forced to live the rest of their 
lives as pure Warriors. The prime attributes of a Paladin are charisma,

locking you out of your character.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it. It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess. We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length. A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.

Keywords PIXIE PIXIES
Related    
Text     Pixies resemble small Elfin creatures with thin gossamer wings. They are 
well characterized with their tinkling laughter and their ability to fly 
about like a dragonfly. Though they are much more intelligent than the 
other races, their concentration is very rarely focused on anything for 
a period of time. When talking to a Pixie, one gets easily frustrated at 
the tendency of Pixies to drift off the subject. Most Pixies prefer to 
be with others of their race and hence very rarely form long lasting
relationships with members of the other races. Pixies are a very spiritual 
race, often spending long times in the forest and close to nature. They
enjoy dancing and singing and mischievous pranks on unsuspecting victims. 
As with the Elves, Pixies have a natural affinity for magic and nature. 
They are also resistant to the effects of magical sleep or charming. 
Because of their small size, the Pixie often chooses the calling of magic 
or thievery. Most Pixies are good or neutral aligned although those of a
darker vein will pursue forbidden arts. Pixie adventurers can also become 
Clerics and Druids.¢

cause the most bizarre contortion of bodily order imaginable. Organs
and tissues are rendered into unrecognizable blobs interconnected in
fiendish, unknowable geometries.
 
Obviously, such an attack has astonishing effects on any physical
creature, as well as any entity which has an extension into the
physical world.

Text     Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms. They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Lands. Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throughout the realm.
  Different quests will result in different awards. Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.
 
Some things to remember while questing:
 
 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of 
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum.
 
 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you. If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.
 
 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most 
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved.¢

Keywords QUIT
Related  RENT, CAMP, AUTORENT
Text     Syntax: quit yes

QUIT causes you to leave the game where you stand, with one small penalty:
Any rare items you are carrying will be dropped to the room as you leave.
This only occurs if the mud's rent system is active, and you will only
get this message using the quit command if you are carrying rares while
the system is on. This penalty will include any equipped rare items you
may have.

Some areas or rooms may not allow you to quit and you will be informed
of such rooms when you are in them. There will be a good reason for why
we mark such areas.

To avoid this penalty, either RENT at an inn, or CAMP in the wilderness.
 
Also, take note: If you lose your link as a means of quitting the game,
there is now a 33% chance that you will be charged 5X the normal rent cost
if you do so while the rent system is on. This is to prevent abuse of the
rent/camp system, but at the same time protects your mundane equipment in
the event your link was cut by lag or some other unforeseen event. In either
case, you will be transported back to the Green Dragon Inn in Bywater.
So if you'd rather avoid all this unpleasantness, find an inn and rent,
camp, or quit in a properly designated area.¢

Related    
Text     A Ranger is the outdoors-man and adventuresome free spirit of the times. 
Known best as a defender of nature and the animals, the Ranger is a force
to be reckoned with. A self-sufficient adventurer, the Ranger is 
adaptable and can survive in almost any locale. Skilled with weapons and 
able to utilize some of the finest armor available, a Ranger is more than
skilled enough to defeat most of his foes. However, for especially hardy 
opponents, a Ranger also can cast many useful spells to both hinder his
opponent and aid himself. From minor curative magics, to calling down 
lightning from a cloudy sky, the Ranger is the most adept class at 
surviving on its own. A Ranger typically travels light, but he does have
the mighty strength of a seasoned Warrior to carry equipment needed in 
his travels. Like the Druid (a class he closely resembles), his need
for help from outside sources is low. All Rangers must remain neutral or
good aligned or they will permanently lose their Ranger abilities and 
become a Warrior. The prime attributes of Rangers are wisdom, strength 
and dexterity. Only Humans, High-Elves, Wild-Elves, Pixies and Centaurs 
can be Ranger classed.¢

General use of the system:
 
Make your way to the redemption room in the Grove.
When you wish to begin a redeem, all you need to do is type:
say redeem <color>
Color is the color of the tokens you have collected to be redeemed. If the
chamber for that color is not occupied, you will then be transported to
the chamber and be prompted from there. Further help is available during
the process simply by typing 'help' at the command prompt.
 
If you plan to colorize your item, then please refer to 'help pcolors' before
beginning the process. You'll have an easier time of things if you plan out
your item description ahead of time. Feel free to test your coloring by using

For those who wish to assure their items are secured from thieves, the
inns are there to help. Find an inn in one of the cities and go to the
reception area. You will be charged only for any rare items you may be
carrying. A rare item is anything with a rent cost of 25000 or higher.
This amount is deducted from your gold when you RENT, and is charged on
a daily basis. Be sure you have enough gold on you to cover your expenses.
Upon your return to the game, you will be informed as to how much rent you
were charged.
 
To find out in advance how much your rent will cost, type OFFER and the
innkeeper will examine your items and list the cost of any rare items you
are carrying.
 
Remember, QUITing without either CAMPing or RENTing will cause you to

Related    
Text     &YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&pverbose&w" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &rcheck the
code&w if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &rlimbo.are,
newdark.are, newacad.are&w.¢

Related    
Text     Sahuagin are shark-like humanoid creatures that live far beneath the
surface of the seas, although they emerge occasionally on raids along
the coastlines.  They are sleek, quick, and cunningly intelligent,
well-suited for the hard life beneath the waves, but they are also
somewhat fragile, and their combative nature makes them hard to get
along with.  Saughin society is very violent, and most members of the
race are considered evil by surfacers, though a sahuagin would be quick
to point out that such measures as mercilessly slaughtering one's foes
are a necessary feature of the life of the deep.  Sahuagin society is
considerably oriented towards the strong, and warriors are very common
among them.  They are also very religious, producing large numbers of
clerics and the occasional antipaladin.  Less common are rogues and
necromancers.
 
Sahuagin are bipedal humanoids, standing a little taller than the
average human.  They have bluish-green scaled skin, and sport a spined
fin down their back.  Their hands and feet are webbed and are furnished
with long, sharp claws, which they use frequently in combat.  A unique
feature of the sahuagin race is their ability to breathe underwater,
which all sahuagin are able to do, as well as their strong swimming
abilities.  In addition, they are attuned to the cold nature of the
oceans, although this makes them somewhat less resistant to heat.¢

The setexit command allows you to manipulate exits from the overland

To create a new exit, simply type 'setexit create' while standing on
your overland map.

To delete an existing exit, simply type 'setexit delete' while standing
on the coordinates of the exit sector. You will probably need to use the
'coords' command to move onto the exit sector.

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Any manipulation of an exit automatically saves the entrances.dat file

do not capitalize words unless referring to names, and do not add punctuation
to the end of the line. To change the description, go to the landmark

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.
Try not to make the distance too large, or too small. Anything visible for

to get to that person. If you become an experienced tracker, you don't
even have to be close to your target to begin tracking it, but until then,
you must at least enter the same zone as your prey.

Related    
Text     As their name implies, the Wild-Elves truly are a wild race. Fun-loving 
thrill seekers, the Wild-Elves are an enigma to their High-Elven cousins. 
Unlike the patient and contemplative High-Elves, the Wild-Elves are an 
emotional and adventurous people. Though basically part of the same 
species, the Wild-Elves are much more muscular and hardier than their 
cousins but they are not as intelligent. They can truly combine inherent 
Elven grace with the fighting fury of a jungle cat, making them awesome 
in battle. Their free and unpredictable ways make enemies of this breed 
of Elvenkind fear to fight them even when they are in their own element. 
Above all else, Wild-Elves hate Necromancers as they see them as defilers
of all that is natural.. Regardless of their ferocity in battle, the 
Wild-Elves are still well known to be a hospitable and friendly race to 
all goodly races, even to the Half-Elves. This is because they understand 
and connect well with all outcasts as the High-Elves treat Wild-Elves with 
the same respect as the Half-Elves. The Wild-Elves have an interesting 
view that all races were created equal, to be children of the land. And no 
race should view itself as superior over another. Even though the 
Wild-Elven race tend to love staying in the forests, many adventuring 
members of their race freely roam all over the land, some even enjoying the 
sociability of cities. Wild-Elves however, connect less to the arcane 
heritage of their race and more to their ties with nature as opposed to 
their High-Elven cousins. Thus, they only practice nature magic or healing 
magic rather than wizardly magic. The Wild-Elf usually becomes a Ranger,
a Druid, or a Warrior, as that is what their race is famed for. 
They can also specialize in the Cleric, Rogue or Bard classes. Wild-Elves 
also have an innate resistance to all forms of magic and the effect of 
magically induced charming. As with all Elvenkind, they also have the 
ability to see in the dark using infravision.

The average Wild-Elf stands about as tall as the High-Elf , being well 
over six feet tall. Most have tanned skin and long, straight hair. They 
are uncannily graceful and have beautiful features. The most distinctive 
feature about Wild-Elves is their pointed ears and their intricate arm 
tattoos.¢
