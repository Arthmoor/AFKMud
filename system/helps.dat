Text SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:

  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:

  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do a 'stat r')
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:

  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"

what equipment you can wear. Trying to wear an antigood item whilst you
are of good alignment will result in you being zapped, dropping the

non-standard and will not be supported.

Areaconvert cannot load CalareyMUD zones due to format incompatibilities.

This command should also be able to load files saved with the Orb area editor, or with 
Nick Gammon's area editor program. No guarantees of course, that would be just wrong :)

This is a one-way conversion, there is no way to convert it back to it's original state 
once it's done. If you need the original unmodified file for some reason, it should still
be sitting right where you left it..... :)

If you're feeling like a gambler and have a whole mess of zones to try to convert, you can
throw caution to the wind and toss them all in your 'area' directory and reboot.            

Keep in mind that whichever method of conversion you choose to attempt, it is }R*NOT*&D
possible to renumber the vnums on the fly!!! So don't even hope for that. If you have a vnum
conflict, you'll need to temporarily stop loading the area causing it, or do the conversion
work by hand. Once you've loaded the new area, renumber it, problem solved.

&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of

Text Usage: assist <character>

When you type "assist <character>" you will begin fighting the same person
that character is.

ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the character continues fighting (and
being beaten upon!). It is better than KILL in many cases because you do
not have to choose between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered
the room). ASSIST will help you to eliminate one aggressor much faster,
by having more than one character fighting one single enemy. Note that
you can assist NPCs, too, should there be a need to.

To make it easier when adventuring with others, there is a CONFIG option
called AUTOASSIST that will have you automatically assist those in your
group, if they engage in battle in the same room as you.

Text Auctioning in the Lands is now handled via various auction houses that
exist in some of the major cities. For specific details on how to use
the system, read the banner posted in an auction house.
 
Items posted for auction will be retained by the auctioneer for up to
1 year of game time. This has been done to curb the problem of leaving
things behind at the shop. An item that exceeds the 1 year storage time
will be donated to the donations area in the Bywater Temple.
 
An item which has been purchased by a player will be kept by the
auctioneer for up to 1 year, from the time of the sale. Afterwards,
if the item has not been picked up, the auctioneer will donate the item
to the temple in Bywater. The seller does not collect for this, to curb the
problem of people bidding on and not collecting their goods.

If an item is sold, the seller cannot collect their money until the buyer
picks up the item!

A seller may only have 10 items offered at an auctioneer at any given time.
This is to prevent 1 person from dominating the shop with too many items.

Sold items should no longer be listed on the auctioneers item list.
 
To counter bid for items currently being sold to someone, use the command: 
Bid <amount>
 
The amount you bid naturally has to be at least 100 gold coins higher than
the current price the item is being sold at.

To pick up an item you have successfully bid and won, you must go to the auction
house and use the command: collect <item>

A player who is authorized by the code offline will be permitted to

To approve a name, simply type 'authorize <name>' and the name will be
approved.
 
To deny a name, and remove the associated player file type:
'authorize <name> no'. This option should only be used for a name that 
is considered extremely offensive, this option will delete the pfile.
 
To have the player change names, type: 'authorize <name> change'.

If the authorize list is somehow broken, IE: a name can't be approved
or denied, type: 'authorize fixlist'.

Levels 103-106 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure there are not any
players waiting for authorization. The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if a name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it. If you are in doubts to a name's acceptability, but it is not profane or

Keywords CAST SPELL
Text Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
Syntax: c <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting. Casting
spells cost mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name. Example: cast 'cure critic' frag. Quoting is optional for
single-word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

To see the help for each spell, simply replace cast with help ;) Remember
to include ' around multiple-word spells for better accuracy.

Keywords CENTAUR CENTAURS
Text With the upper body of a Human and the lower body of a horse, Centaurs 
are among the most intriguing of all the races. Secretive and mysterious 
creatures with an affinity for nature and the element of wind, they roam 
the lands as adventurers or caretakers of nature. Hence, members of this 
mellow tempered race prefer to avoid cities and heavily populated 
settlements. It is not really known if there are any such things as 
Centaur settlements as none have been observed, though there are many 
rumors of a secret Centaur forest. With well muscled torsos and four 
powerful legs like that of the horse, Centaurs are extremely dextrous and 
can outrun anything travelling on land. However, since they are such a 
solitary race, their lack of contact with those of other races impacts on 
their charisma and their knowledge of the technologies in the land. As 
they are so close to nature, very rarely does one find a Centaur on the 
side of evil. Most prefer to follow the ways of neutrality. Centaurs are 
masters of archery, their skills with the bow legendary even among the
Elven kind. Thus, most Centaurs become Rangers, or they strive to be 
protectors of nature as Druids. They are also able to take up the Warrior 
or Cleric classes.

Centaurs stand anywhere between five foot four inches to six feet tall 
with long flowing hair. Their upper torsos appear in all ways to be 
Human-like while their lower bodies resemble that of horses. They have 
four powerful legs and they can use both their hind legs and fore legs 
to deliver crushing kicks to their opponents. When encountering a 
Centaur, never ever ask to ride on them as this is a grave insult.

There will also be question rooms found in the challenges where you have to
answer a question based on the lore of the lands. If you answer correctly,

Keywords DEATH
Text When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the temple.
Up until you reach level 10, your corpse will be brought back to the temple
with you. After that, your corpse is left behind where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment, and your gold.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time. The longer the corpse exists, the more rotten it
becomes. Eventually it will become nothing but a skeleton. Skeletons will
last for several hours of real time before decaying into dust. Your items
and gold will remain with your corpse or skeleton. As long as this is the
case, your stuff is safe from reboots and crashes. Once the skeleton decays,
your items and gold will be laying on the ground. At this point a crash or
reboot will result in item/gold loss.

Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.

If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse. Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.

Text Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of rogues.

their own kind. They are a race wholly dedicated to the tenets of evil 
and will mercilessly slaughter those that get in their way. They especially 
hate their surface dwelling cousins. Although they are physically weaker 
than the surface Elves, the Drow more than make up for their lack of 
strength with their uncanny agility and stunning intelligence. This mental
readiness gives them a deadly intellectual edge over most creatures. They 
are whispered to be even more talented in magic than their High-Elven 
cousins. As race that has lived in darkness for centuries on end, the 
Drow learn to use shadows for expert concealment from prying eyes. Unlike 
any other known race, the Drow follow a matriarchal hierarchy. Drow 
females tend to have more power and authority in their cities than the 
males, especially the Drow priestesses. Experts at stealth and the arcane, 
the Drow tend to favour the Mage, Necromancer, and Cleric classes.
They can also become fearsome Warriors or successful Rogues. 
As with all Elvenkind, the Drow have an innate resistance to sleep and 
charm enchantments and they have the ability of infravision.

As beautiful as their Elven kin, the Drow have uniformly jet-black skin. 
They are lithe, slim and graceful in build. A majority of them have

mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work. 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged

spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the 
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of
nature which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and 
split the sky, Druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a 
hobby, but a way of life for them. Able to face many warriors on almost
even footing, and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some Mages,
Druids are truly a gifted class. All those of the Druidic order must be 
careful to remain neutrally aligned at all times or they will permanently 
lose all their Druid powers and become Clerics. The Druid relies on wisdom

more sly and cunning, almost always preferring to use underhanded fighting
techniques such as poisoning, crippling and blinding attacks. All Dwarves 
and Duergar are blood-adversaries, and will attack each other on sight 
with a ruthlessness that is second only to the Drow. The Duergar have the 
reputation of being one of the most feared races in the land, not only
for their bloodthirsty nature but also for their expertise in assassination.
Their thick, muscular frames coupled with their short stature give them 
poor dexterity, but high stamina and strength give them the edge needed in 
their element. The prime aims of the Duergar is to conquer and expand their
holdings. As with the Dwarves, they covet precious metals and gems but 
unlike their cousins, they also seek out valuable magical treasures. 
Because of their dark dealings with the forces of evil, all dark dwarves 
have an innate resistance against draining spells. They also possess the 
inherent ability to see all that is hidden from normal view. Duergar 
adventurers make excellent Warriors. Besides this, they can also 
endeavour to become expert Rogues or Clerics.

Duergar average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with pale 
white complexions and thick, hairy torsos and limbs. Their eyes come in a

Keywords FLOODFILL
Text Syntax: mapedit fill <sectortype>
Syntax: mapedit undo

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained
section of the map into another kind of terrain. It operates much the same way
as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to 
change everything inside the boundry from what your standing on, into what you 
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundry,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

If for some reason you need to undo what you've just filled in, simply type:
'mapedit undo' and your last floodfill will be reversed.

knowledge. Though they do not strike anyone who encounters them for the 
first time as a race to be feared, those that make this mistake will soon 
learn why most other people stay well clear of Gnomes. The Gnomes are 
fixated with new sciences and with inventing new gadgets to make life
for everyone easier. This tinkering and inventing will more than often 
result in dire consequences for those around the Gnome when some insane 
invention goes awry and starts exploding or laying waste to the 
countryside. Even though most Gnomes mean well, they are prone to many
unfortunate accidents which have gained them a great amount of notoriety. 
Thus, most of the Gnomes are left alone in the homeland of 
Mount Nevermore. No other race wants to attack nor conquer them for the
risk in getting blown up by a stray invention. Gnomish adventurers are a 
very friendly and loyal lot. They love to travel and learn new lores with 
fellow companions although they rarely lead adventuring parties as they 
are very unpredictable. As they are not very physically strong nor hardy, 
Gnomes rely on their keen intellect and wisdom to survive. Because of 
this, they make excellent Mages and Clerics. Some Gnomish adventurers 
have also been known to become reknowned Warriors and Rogues. All Gnomes 
also have the ability to see in total darkness.

are less muscular and stocky. They have a wizened, thoughtful look on 
their faces when they are thinking but this changes often to one of glee 
and excitement when they get a new idea for an invention. Some older

It would seem that this race has also inherited the behavioural 
characteristics of both the Humans and the Elves. They are known to be 
as stubborn and headstrong as the Humans and as graceful the Elves. A 
common trait among Half-Elves is their warm and friendly personality 
towards all races with the exception of the evil races. This comes
mainly from the fact that they understand the disdain and discrimination 
which some of the more old fashioned High-Elves show towards them and 
hence they try their best not to follow in the narrow minded High-Elves' 
foolish ways. Half-Elven adventurers serve the best in classes which 
require a good mix of mental and physical dexterity without demanding 
superiority in either. This trait makes them excellent Bards.
They can also endeavour to become any class besides the 
Paladin, Anti-Paladin, Druid or Ranger. Also inherited from their Elven 
blood is the ability to see in the dark using infravision.

Though not as tall as the pure blooded Elf, a Half-Elf is a relatively 
tall creature ranging from five foot five inches to six foot five inches. 
The males have a generally more muscular build than pure blooded Elves

race. Usually standing from six to nine feet in height and packed with
rippling muscles, they possess great skill in battle, enabling this race 
to thrive in battle. Half-Ogres never settle down in communities, most 
preferring to join moving war tribes and pillage what they need from the 
other races. Some however do travel alone in the world, seeking to spread 
chaos and death. Half-Ogres tend to also be dim-witted and can be 
outsmarted by most other races. However they usually get their own back
using brute strength and crude, direct tactics. They dont shun away from 
fights except when hopelessly overpowered and often engage in battle to 
establish superiority, even within their own tribes. Perhaps the only 
thing which strikes fear into a Half-Ogres heart is the use of magic, 
simply because they do not understand it. A powerful frame coupled with 
the ability to see in the dark, the Half-Ogre is a natural born Warrior 
and can specialize only in that and the Cleric class. Most of their race 
love to wield huge weapons that can crush bones in a single blow such as 
clubs, battle axes, sledgehammers and large tridents.

Half-Ogres usually come in skin colors ranging from an orangy tinge to a 
greenish hue. The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogres are commonly covered 
in small, bony, armor-like growths which protect them from attacks. Most 
are relatively hairless, with disproportional limbs and bent, muscular
legs, giving many a stooping appearance. Some Half-Ogres wear a necklace

Keywords HIGH-ELF HIGH-ELVES
Text Tall, slender creatures with a spiritual affinity for nature and magic. 
High Elves are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence 
and dexterity of that winged race to a lesser degree. Most High Elves are
regal and aloof from the other races as they perceive themselves to be 
the first mortal beings in the world. A contemplative and patient race, 
the High Elves are amongst the longest lived races in the land with lives 
spanning centuries. Almost all High Elves dabble in magic, some even do
it unknowingly. Those that dedicate their lives to the pursuit of magical 
arts live to become very powerful magic users. Most High Elves work on
the side of goodness, travelling throughout the land to right the wrongs 
and to vanquish evil creatures. However, there are those High Elves that 
have been seduced by darker arts and are seen as outcasts to the Elven 
race. Because of their affinity, the Elves have the inherent ability to 
resist magical sleep or charming. They also have the ability to see in 
the dark. High Elven adventurers have the capability to become any class 
except Necromancers, Paladins and Anti-Paladins, though they 
function best in their element and many prefer to be Mages, Druids 
or Rangers.

The average High Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six 
feet tall. most have fair skin and long, straight hair. They are 
uncannily graceful and have beautiful, delicate features. The most 
distinctive feature about High Elves is their pointed ears.

Text Usage : hotboot

This command "hot" boots the mud with a bare minimum of interruption in
gameplay. This is accomplished by saving all the important data (i.e.
player status, position, etc) and initializing an online boot sequence.
All of the data is then reloaded into memory and things continue from
where it was saved. There are a few things that can only take effect after 
a "hard" boot, but almost all minor changes and copied area files will work 
after using hotbooting.

Keywords HUMAN HUMANS
Text Humans are the most common and numerous of the races. This however makes 
them no less interesting. They possess no special abilities or bonuses, 
but also have no penalties. Because of this, Humans are the most adaptable 
of all the other races. They can assume and often excel at a variety of 
roles. Humans also live very exciting lives. Because of their relatively 
short lifespans, they tend to do as much adventuring as they can, 
accomplishing much in their lives. Humans also have a range of 
personalities and values, such that no two humans behave exactly alike. 
All in all, humans are a very exciting and lively race.

Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish 
head. Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look very different 
from each other. Differences in skin coloring, size, hair and eye color, 
speech and facial features are among the things that distinguishes one 
human from another.

Ignore allows you to completely block out any and all forms of communication
or action from any character you select. You will not see their global
communications, their in-room communications, their social actions, or
their tells. You will also not be heard on any of these communication channels
by the ignored character. You will not be listed as a person in the room with
them, or be seen on the who list by them. Think of it as a stealth field to
keep the character from ever knowing you exist.
 
Typing 'ignore' by itself will list your currently ignored players.
 
Typing 'ignore <character>' will add or remove that character from your list
of ignores. Only valid character names can be added, it will check to see
if that person has a pfile.

Keywords IGUANADON IGUANADONS
Text Well known throughout the free Lands for their fearsome visages and 
ferocious savagery, the terrifying Iguanadons are also the most mysterious 
of all races. Though they are rumored to have been descended from the 
giant lizards of the past and that the blood of Dragons courses through
their veins, no one knows for sure the exact origins of this dangerous 
race. Even the locations of Iguanadons settlements are not commonly known. 
Secretive and often solitary, the Iguanadons travel to all parts of the 
world, working to further some dark and unknown purpose. Hence, they tend 
to avoid most major settlements for fear of being attacked by those that 
do not understand them. Sleek and well muscled, the Iguanadon is 
relatively stronger and more agile than most races though they are less 
intelligent and wise. As they are semi-aquatic creatures with the ability 
to breathe underwater for long periods of time, most Iguanadons prefer 
the dampness of humid areas such as swamps, rivers and underwater caverns.
One would almost never encounter an Iguanadon in a dry and hot climate
such as deserts. Because of their reptilian nature, all Iguanadons are 
resistant to cold based attacks. While Iguanadons make exemplary Warriors,
those of the other races speak of Iguandons Rogues with great dread for 
their skills are near matchless with the exception of the Duergar and 
the Drow. Rarely, Iguanadon Clerics can also be found wandering the Land.
                                       
The Iguanadon stands about a head taller than the average Human. 
Physically they appear to be giant manlike lizards who stand upright like 
most humanoid races. Sharp claws and a powerful tail add to their 
deadliness in combat. Their scaly, cold bodies are excellent for spending 
prolonged time in cold and wet areas. Most Iguanadons have greenish to 
grey skin and their eyes are a dull yellow color.

IMPLOCK is a toggle command, much like wizlock, with the exception that
it also prevents immortals below level 113 from logging in as well.
Connected players and immortals who lose their links will NOT be able to
reconnect past an implock. This would be grounds for reimbursement of
any mortal affected by this if they lose their inventory.

This command is not to be used casually, it is intended to lock the mud
down in the even of a critical problem or bug, or perhaps even a
security risk of some kind. Be prepared to explain the reason for an
implock to any other imps who ask.

If the situation is dire enough, then the head implementor may wish to
deploy a total LOCKDOWN to reduce possible damage to the game files or
to disk space on the server itself.

Implock will persist across reboots so it will not be necessary to relock
the mud in the event of crashes or reboots. A message informing other
imps will be displayed as they log in.

Keywords LINKDEAD
Text A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

 Addendum to II : you can reconnect without dropping link.  This is known as
    usurping your body.  Therefore, you never have to ask for a disconnect.
    So, if your link freezes, and you can open another telnet (or tin, or 
    whatever) session, you're in good shape.

  If you go linkdead while not in combat, you run the serious risk
of not only being assaulted by aggressive monsters, but of dying of either
hunger, or thirst, or both while you are away. You will remain where you
were for aproximately 15 minutes before the game flags you as idle. Once
you are flagged idle, monsters will stop bothering you. You are still
subject to hunger and thirst. After approximately 30 minutes, you will
be autorented out of the game.

their links during a lockdown, they will not be able to reconnect.
Players who lose inventory due to a lockdown WILL be reimbursed for their
loss.

This is by no means a casual command to use, it is meant to be deployed
when an extremely critical problem, bug, or even security risk comes about,
especially when said problem is causing damage to files, or threatening the
disk space alloted to the game by the quotas in place. Also possible this 
command will be used to halt all operations of the game during server 
transfers.

Lockdown persists across reboots, so it will not be necessary to relock
the game in the even of a crash or reboot. A mesage will be displayed to
the implementor as they log in reminding them the game is under a lockdown.

Only the implementor himself will be allowed use of this command. This help

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.

character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

Abusing this command will result in disciplinary action, ranging from

while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out

easily identified for it has the head of a bull and the body of a 
humanoid. Gruff and short tempered, they prefer to travel alone or only 
with others of their own kind. Minotaur adventurers have one aim in life, 
to seek out new challenges and best them. Because of their impatient and
practical natures, Minotaurs prefer to put their effort and time into 
learning survival skills rather than scholarly skills. Thus they are 
viewed as less intelligent than most other races. However when in battle, 
few come close to the sheer ferocity and determination of a Minotaur. 
Nearly all Minotaurs view magic with disdain as they see it as a 
weakling's art. To them, reliance on an outside power is cowardly 
compared to relying on one's physical skills. Thus with the exception of 
the Clerics in their race, Minotaurs do not dabble in magic. Oddly, when 
they are not fighting with each other, Minotaurs and Dwarves make good 
company as they are very alike in mind. The Minotaur is capable in the 
Warrior and Cleric classes. They also have the ability to see in the dark.

The average Minotaur stands taller than most races. Most have either a 
reddish brown or a stony-grey colored skin. A pair of long, sharp horns 
grow from atop their muscled heads which they use for goring their 
opponents. Minotaurs are relatively hairless and usually prefer to wear

had a mob that you wanted to give a different response if he had been there
already THIS LOGIN (note that to make it permanent you'd just need to use
a qbit instead). You could use the following to check the status of the bit
and respond properly:

&Yif hasabit($n) == 3100
say Welcome back, $n.
else
say You're new around here, aren't you, $n?
mpaset $n 3100
endif&D

Notice that after checking for the bit, the mob responds with the appropriate
greeting, then sets it on the 'else' if they had not been there yet. If you
want to check the opposite status of the bit (player hasn't been set with
that particular bit yet), use != instead.

Keywords Monk
Text A master of ancient hand-to-hand combat,the Monk stands without par.
No other class has the ability to control and tone its physical form into
such a deadly combination of spirit and fighting prowess.Because they
have such mastery, Monks rarely need any weapons at all when adventuring.
Their punches and kicks alone can shatter and pound the hardest of
substances. However, combat is not everything this breed of adventurer
strives to excel in. The Monk class also relies on its stealth, agility and
spiritual hardiness against most elements that seek to harm it,making
them excellent explorers and worthy additions to any adventuring parties.
For this, the Monk class relies on no one attribute but rather a well
balanced set of attributes. However because of the rigorous discipline
and concentration required to become a Monk, only Humans and Insectoids
can become adept in this class.

Keywords NAME NAMES
Text &YSyntax: name <newname>&z

a new one if their original choice has been denied.

  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type: &YName Joe&z.
 
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both medieval
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &YNOT &zbe:&G

 - Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
 - Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 - Futuristic or common, such as 'Jill' or 'Laser'.
 - Similar to that of any Immortal, major mob, or equipment.
 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,
    as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'.
 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Joe as 'Eoj'.
 
&zPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the
validity of a name on the Lands is the discretion of the Immortals
and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied,
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

NOTE: Once a name has been deemed unacceptable, it will not be possible
for anyone else to try and log on with it in the future.

Keywords PASSWORD
Text Syntax: password <new password> <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password. You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work. This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it. It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess. We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length. A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

Text When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>

In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is. Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'. Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked. Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter]. Your password will be shown on your

Keywords PIXIE PIXIES
Text Pixies resemble small Elfin creatures with thin gossamer wings. They are 
well characterised with their tinkling laughter and their ability to fly 
about like a dragonfly. Though they are much more intelligent than the 
other races, their concentration is very rarely focused on anything for 
a period of time. When talking to a Pixie, one gets easily frustrated at 
the tendency of Pixies to drift off the subject. Most Pixies prefer to 
be with others of their race and hence very rarely form long lasting
relationships with members of the other races. Pixies are a very spiritual 
race, often spending long times in the forest and close to nature. They
enjoy dancing and singing and mischievous pranks on unsuspecting victims. 
As with the Elves, Pixies have a natural affinity for magic and nature. 
They are also resistant to the effects of magical sleep or charming. 
Because of their small size, the Pixie often chooses the calling of magic 
or thievery. Most Pixies are good or neutral aligned although those of a
darker vein will pursue forbidden arts. Pixie adventurers can also become 
Clerics and Druids.

Lastly, provided you have a projectile in inventory, and a firing
weapon wielded in the 'missile wielded' position, you are ready to

Keywords RANGER RANGERS
Text A Ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times. 
Known best as a defender of nature and the animals, the Ranger is a force
to be reckoned with. A self-sufficient adventurer, the Ranger is 
adaptable and can survive in almost any locale. Skilled with weapons and 
able to utilise some of the finest armor available, a Ranger is more than
skilled enough to defeat most of his foes. However, for especially hardy 
opponents, a Ranger also can cast many useful spells to both hinder his
opponent and aid himself. From minor curative magics, to calling down 
lightning from a cloudy sky, the Ranger is the most adept class at 
surviving on its own. A Ranger typically travels light, but he does have
the mighty strength of a seasoned Warrior to carry equipment needed in 
his travels. Like the Druid (a class he closely resembles), his need
for help from outside sources is low. All Rangers must remain neutral or
good aligned or they will permanently lose their Ranger abilities and 
become a Warrior. The prime attributes of Rangers are wisdom, strength 
and dexterity. Only Humans, High-Elves, Wild-Elves, Pixies and Centaurs 
can be Ranger classed.

The code will not make any exceptions to this.
 
General use of the system:
 
Make your way to the redemption room in the Grove.
When you wish to begin a redeem, all you need to do is type:
say redeem <color>
Color is the color of the tokens you have collected to be redeemed. If the
chamber for that color is not occupied, you will then be transported to
the chamber and be prompted from there. Further help is available during
the process simply by typing 'help' at the command prompt.
 
If you plan to colorize your item, then please refer to 'help pcolors' before
beginning the process. You'll have an easier time of things if you plan out
your item description ahead of time. Feel free to test your coloring by using
the SAY channel while in the redemption chambers.

And if anything should go wrong during the process, don't hesitate to contact
the first immortal you see, or to post a message on the boards.

Keywords RENUMBER
Text &YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &rcheck the
code&w if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &rlimbo.are,
newdark.are, newacad.are&w.

Text Sahuagin are shark-like humanoid creatures that live far beneath the
surface of the seas, although they emerge occasionally on raids along
the coastlines.  They are sleek, quick, and cunningly intelligent,
well-suited for the hard life beneath the waves, but they are also
somewhat fragile, and their combative nature makes them hard to get
along with.  Saughin society is very violent, and most members of the
race are considered evil by surfacers, though a sahuagin would be quick
to point out that such measures as mercilessly slaughtering one's foes
are a necessary feature of the life of the deep.  Sahuagin society is
considerably oriented towards the strong, and warriors are very common
among them.  They are also very religious, producing large numbers of
clerics and the occasional antipaladin.  Less common are rogues and
necromancers.
 
Sahuagin are bipedal humanoids, standing a little taller than the
average human.  They have bluish-green scaled skin, and sport a spined
fin down their back.  Their hands and feet are webbed and are furnished
with long, sharp claws, which they use frequently in combat.  A unique
feature of the sahuagin race is their ability to breathe underwater,
which all sahuagin are able to do, as well as their strong swimming
abilities.  In addition, they are attuned to the cold nature of the
oceans, although this makes them somewhat less resistant to heat.

Syntax: setexit <vnum>
Syntax: setexit map <mapname> <X-coord> <Y-coord>

The setexit command allows you to manipulate exits from the overland
to rooms or other maps. The command is fairly straightforward.

To create a new exit, simply type 'setexit create' while standing on
your overland map.

To delete an existing exit, simply type 'setexit delete' while standing
on the coordinates of the exit sector. You will probably need to use the
'coords' command to move onto the exit sector.

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Any manipulation of an exit automatically saves the entrances.dat file
to disk, so there is no need to worry about saving that file.

Landmarks are the points on the overland maps that the survey command uses
to display its information to players. The data is stored in a simple text
file in the directory with the ANSI maps.

To add a landmark, go to the coordinates you want it to be at and simply
type: setmark add

To remove one, go to the coordinates it is at and simply type:
setmark delete

The description is just a short line of text to describe what the survey
command sees. When editing the description, keep it as short as possible,
do not capitalize words unless referring to names, and do not add punctuation
to the end of the line. To change the description, go to the landmark
coordinates and type: setmark desc <text>, Where <text> is the
description you want.

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.
Try not to make the distance too large, or too small. Anything visible for
more than 50 or so spaces is most likely too large - unless the landmark is
intended to display a large geographical feature such as a mountain.

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level. This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera. You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character. You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

Keywords USEPROG
Text Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used. To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke

When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will see will be any mpechoes
placed in the program. Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog
(see MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.

The first field, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.

The second field is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)

The third field is the number of seconds the user has been idle.

The fourth field is the character's name.

Last is the users host address. The player's username may or may not

Keywords WILD-ELF WILD-ELVES
Text As their name implies, the Wild-Elves truly are a wild race. Fun-loving 
thrill seekers, the Wild-Elves are an enigma to their High-Elven cousins. 
Unlike the patient and contemplative High-Elves, the Wild-Elves are an 
emotional and adventurous people. Though basically part of the same 
species, the Wild-Elves are much more muscular and hardier than their 
cousins but they are not as intelligent. They can truly combine inherent 
Elven grace with the fighting fury of a jungle cat, making them awesome 
in battle. Their free and unpredictable ways make enemies of this breed 
of Elvenkind fear to fight them even when they are in their own element. 
Above all else, Wild-Elves hate Necromancers as they see them as defilers
of all that is natural.. Regardless of their ferocity in battle, the 
Wild-Elves are still well known to be a hospitable and friendly race to 
all goodly races, even to the Half-Elves. This is because they understand 
and connect well with all outcasts as the High-Elves treat Wild-Elves with 
the same respect as the Half-Elves. The Wild-Elves have an interesting 
view that all races were created equal, to be children of the land. And no 
race should view itself as superior over another. Even though the 
Wild-Elven race tend to love staying in the forests, many adventuring 
members of their race freely roam all over the land, some even enjoying the 
sociality of cities. Wild-Elves however, connect less to the arcane 
heritage of their race and more to their ties with nature as opposed to 
their High-Elven cousins. Thus, they only practise nature magic or healing 
magic rather than wizardly magic. The Wild-Elf usually becomes a Ranger,
a Druid, or a Warrior, as that is what their race is famed for. 
They can also specialize in the Cleric, Rogue or Bard classes. Wild-Elves 
also have an innate resistance to all forms of magic and the effect of 
magically induced charming. As with all Elvenkind, they also have the 
ability to see in the dark using infravision.

The average Wild-Elf stands about as tall as the High-Elf , being well 
over six feet tall. Most have tanned skin and long, straight hair. They 
are uncannily graceful and have beautiful features. The most distinctive 
feature about Wild-Elves is their pointed ears and their intricate arm 
tattoos.

Mindflayers used them for warring with the other races as the Mindflayers 
themselves were physically weak and only relied on their tremendous 
mental powers to overcome obstacles. Eventually, a saviour named Gith 
led them to freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers 
of their Illithid masters. The Gith found themselves stronger, quicker, 
luckier and smarter than the average Humans, yet they had lost much of 
their faith, wisdom, stamina and charisma. They also discovered that 
they had the natural ability to resist all forms of magically induced 
charming and sleep and they could also detect all types invisible 
enchantments. Perhaps because of their long-term contact with the mental 
powers of the Illithids, the Gith have acquired some powers of the mind. 
Because of this, most Gith specialize in the arts of the Mage.
They can also become Warriors, Necromancers, Clerics, or Rogues.

The Gith have yellowed skin and are very long of limb. Sunken eyes peer 
from pale sockets, unblinking and rarely betraying a hint of emotion.

Insectoids generally stand anywhere from 5 feet to over 7 in height, and

from attacks. They range from a dull red to a light brown color. Insectoids
tend to be nimble and wise, but somewhat less intelligent and lucky than
normal. Due to their strange nature, most races tend to look on them a bit

somewhat more resistant to fire, but this is offset by their susceptibility

and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time

only display 1,000 at a time.
