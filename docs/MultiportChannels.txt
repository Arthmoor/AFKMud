AFKMud: Multiport channel setup - Quick and dirty style
-------------------------------------------------------

Ok. This mini-doc assumes you have the codebase successfully compiled
with the multiport options enabled. If not, you need to go back and do
that part first.

1. In the mudmsg.cpp file, there is a line like this:

#define IPC_KEY_FILE "/home/alsherok/mudmsgkeyDONTDELETEME"

You'll need to change the file path specified to something you own, or
that you can access that the server itself owns. If you plan to try and
link muds owned by different users, you *NEED* to get in touch with the
system administrator and clear it through them first - don't just link to
any old random file. This needs to be something non-critical that won't be
deleted by accident but is also not important to the server.

Recompile once this has been settled and a file has been chosen.

2. Reboot and log in to the mud.
Using the setchannel command, type the following:

setchannel <some name> flags interport

<some name> should be the name of a channel you want shared. Keep in mind
this will be something others on the other ports can see. Recommended to
test with an imm only channel at first.

That should take care of it.
