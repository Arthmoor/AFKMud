AFKMud: Automatic Rent Generation
Written by Dwip, 5/31/03
------------------------

This document is an effort to explain the various parts of the rent system
used by AFKMud, and how to modify them.

I'll assume that you the reader understand what rent is and how it works,
in general. That having been said, there are five values an item can have
in it's rent field:

0 <-> 24,998: Rent value is disregarded, and the item costs nothing to rent.
This is used for most normal items. Limit values do not apply.

24,999 : Limited items. No rent is charged on the item, but the item does
possess an "ego" which limits use by lower level characters. This setting
is used for items that are more powerful than normal, but not extremely
powerful. Limits also apply. If for example a limit of 5 is set, there
can only be 5 copies in play at one time and none will reset until the
copies are removed from play. Logging out with one in your possession
counts toward removing it from play.

25,000+ : Rent item. Rent is charged on the item, and it possesses an
"ego" limiting use by lower level characters. This setting is used for
items that are very powerful. Limit values set on these items are enforced
globally and the items will NOT reset until the copies are actually
destroyed, including those saved on players which are logged out of play.

A note on the above two conditions - the 24,999 and 25,000 values are settable
using the cset command. 25,000 is the default minimum value which is decided
by you. 24,999 works relative to that and will change based on the value
you assign.

-1 : The item is deleted from character's inventory upon exiting the game.
Used for items that are so powerful that they should not be carried longterm,
or for things like keys that should be deleted on exit so as to encourage
exploration.

-2 : Sets up automatic calculation of one of the other four rent values.
This part of the system is explained in greater detail below and is the
primary purpose for this document.

----------------------------------

A note on balance. The automatic system described here is essentially the
same one that has been used successfully by Alsherok for 6 years now. It is
also based on the same system which worked successfully at Crystal Shard for
5+ years before that. So it's been tried and true for nearly 11 years. Thus
it should work in most cases. However, there are still times when manual
setting of rent is advisable - special quest items (like sindhae prizes),
keys, and the like.

-----------------------------------

In general, the way the system works is that the calc code in rent.c looks
over the item and adds up all of the various rent-worthy affects on the item.
There are a few exceptions, however, which automatically set the item rent to
-1. This is all editable by looking in the calc_aff_rent function in rent.c
for most things. Spell rent values are set by using sset. That having been
said, the entire list of item affects looked at by calc_aff_rent.

If an affect isn't checked, that means the affect is either so totally
unbalanced it has to be set on an individual case basis, isn't used
anywhere so there's no point, or when using it would be totally illogical
or break the game.

Spells marked -2 generate error messages when used on items.
Spells marked -1 autoset the rent to -1.
Spell rent is manually set, works like this, usually:

For damaging spells, take average damage and multiple by 1000.
For area spells, add 10000.
For affect-giving spells, like +str, use the proper affect rent.
For suscept flag spells, treat the suscept like a resist.
For any fireshield, etc spell, use (avg damage * 1000) + 16000.
Add it all together to get the proper rent value for the spell.
There are of course certain spells that should be set to 0 or -1 for special reasons.

-----------------------------------
